Man‐made disaster that occurs at an industrial organization, may develop into an industrial crisis. Crisis can happen to any organization. It has been noted that there were no universally accepted definitions yet developed for disaster and crisis. There is also no universally available criteria, to define the disaster in terms of the consequences, such as the casualties and the cost of damage. This paper reviews the definitions, types, characteristics, criteria and models of disaster and crisis. Also the types of crisis were rearranged and the differences between the disasters and crises have been summarized.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This chapter differentiates the stressful consequences of social organization from the stressful antecedents of psychological disorder. The pivotal distinction concerns whether the occurrence of stressors is viewed as socially determined, or as independent of social placement. Recent research is evaluated concerning both the social distribution of stress and social variation in response to stress. Two particularly productive areas of inquiry are also reviewed: self-efficacy as a mediator between social position and stress; and the intersection of macro- and micro-stress processes in economic and occupational spheres, with emphasis upon gender stratification. This review concludes that the occurrence of systemic stressors is not necessarily an indication of a social system run amok but may reflect instead the system functioning precisely as it is supposed to function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.1177/0268396220929258},
	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In recent times societal crises such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak have given rise to a tension between formal ‘command and control’ and informal social media activated self-organising information and communication systems that are utilised for crisis management decision-making. Social media distrust affects the dissemination of disaster information as it entails shifts in media perception and participation but also changes in the way individuals and organisations make sense of information in critical situations. So far, a little considered notion in this domain is the concept of sense-giving. Originating from organisational theory, it is used to explain the mechanisms behind intentional information provision that fosters collective meaning creation. In our study, we seek to understand the potential impact of sense-giving from Twitter crisis communication generated during the Hurricane Harvey disaster event. Social network and content analyses performed with a dataset of 9,414,463 tweets yielded insights into how sense-giving occurs during a large-scale disaster event. Theoretically, we specified (1) perpetual sense-giving, which relies primarily on topical authority and frequency; as well as (2) intermittent sense-giving, which occurs from high value of message content and leverage of popularity, that is, retweets. Our findings emphasise the importance of information-rich actors in communication networks and the leverage of their influence in crises such as coronavirus disease 2019 to reduce social media distrust and facilitate sense-making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

RECENT FINDINGS: Economic recessions and crises have a context-dependent negative impact on mental health disorders. These appear in low-income and middle-income countries whereas some affluent countries are offering provisions that help unemployed persons to escape the detrimental consequences. SUMMARY: The Asian economic crisis led to a sharp unemployment-related increase in suicide mortality in east Asian countries. In European Union countries rising unemployment was associated with significant short-term increases in premature deaths from intentional violence including suicides. It seems that active labour market programmes existing in some Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries can prevent some adverse health effects of economic downturns. As mental health consequences of economic crises are context dependent, the current situation needs monitoring. Enough services for those in need should be provided and advocacy for societal support measures is of great importance.},

	abstract = {From the Arab Spring and los indignados in Spain, to Occupy Wall Street (and beyond), large-scale, sustained protests are using digital media in ways that go beyond sending and receiving messages. Some of these action formations contain relatively small roles for formal brick and mortar organizations. Others involve well-established advocacy organizations, in hybrid relations with other organizations, using technologies that enable personalized public engagement. Both stand in contrast to the more familiar organizationally managed and brokered action conventionally associated with social movement and issue advocacy. This article examines the organizational dynamics that emerge when communication becomes a prominent part of organizational structure. It argues that understanding such variations in large-scale action networks requires distinguishing between at least two logics that may be in play: The familiar logic of collective action associated with high levels of organizational resources and the formation of collective identities, and the less familiar logic of connective action based on personalized content sharing across media networks. In the former, introducing digital media do not change the core dynamics of the action. In the case of the latter, they do. Building on these distinctions, the article presents three ideal types of large-scale action networks that are becoming prominent in the contentious politics of the contemporary era.},

The concept of connective action has been introduced to characterize such new forms of collective engagement in which actors coproduce and circulate content based upon an issue of mutual interest. Yet, how the use of social media actually affords connective action still needed to be investigated. Mixed methods analyses of microblogging use during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill bring insights onto this question and reveal in particular how multiple actors enacted emerging and interdependent roles with their distinct patterns of feature use. The findings allow us to elaborate upon the concept of connective affordances as collective level affordances actualized by actors in team interdependent roles. Connective affordances extend research on affordances as a relational concept by considering not only the relationships between technology and users but also the interdependence type among users and the effects of this interdependence onto what users can do with the technology. This study contributes to research on social media use by paying close attention to how distinct patterns of feature use enact emerging roles. Adding to IS scholarship on the collective use of technology, it considers how the patterns of feature use for emerging groups of actors are intricately and mutually related to each other.},

By adopting a multidimensional empowerment perspective and extending the temporal scope in examining social media-enabled social movements, this study expounds on the logic of connective action (in contrast to the conventional logic of collective action) to offer a theory of social media empowerment. The study builds on a case study of an environmental movement to derive two key contributions: (1) it extends our knowledge of grassroots organising through a conceptualisation of the processes of how social media can allow individuals to assume a more proactive role in driving a social movement and (2) it provides a new understanding of the use of social media to sustain activism over time through the conceptualisation of social media empowerment mechanisms.

Videos providing informational and emotional support received more likes.

Emotional recognition is the automatic identification of a person's emotional state by acquiring a person's physiological or non-physiological signals to achieve a more friendly and natural human-computer interaction. Similarities between the spread of infectious diseases and behavioral phenomena have been observed in large social networks. Accordingly, a framework for the spread of social phenomena, such as happiness and obesity, has been reported. Whereas this framework shows striking resemblance to the SIS-style infectious disease model, it does not demonstrate factors that influence the diameter of social networks, or explain the low degrees of separation among participants of the Framingham Heart study. The diameter is the primary parameter for understand the emotion contagions in large social networks. Although classical models for discussing these phenomena are available, models for the spread of happiness require factors that are relevant to emotional transmissions, such as the non-contact factors described in the previous SIS-style model. The proposed in this paper Markov chain-style random walk model robustly indicated a diameter of only 3 degrees of separation in this social network, and may represent the spread of happiness in these social networks more accurately than the SIS-style model.},

We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social network. We introduce a novel form of the classical susceptible–infected–susceptible disease model which includes the possibility for ‘spontaneous’ (or ‘automatic’) infection, in addition to disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the average lifetime of a contentment ‘infection’ (10 years) or discontentment ‘infection’ (5 years). Our results give insight into the transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states. Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are infectious is a promising direction for further research with important implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions, behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.},

As the response to COVID-19 has reduced face-to-face contact, communication via social media has increased. Evidence shows that social media affects disease (non-)prevention through the (im)proper distribution of information, and distorts the predictive accuracy of infection models, including legacy Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered (SEIR) models. Our adjusted SEIR model reflects the effectiveness of information disseminated through social media by accounting for dimensions of social/informational motivation based on social learning/use and gratification theories, and uses Monte Carlo methodology and computational algorithms to predict effects of social media on the spread of COVID-19 (N = 2,095 cases). The results suggest that social media utilisation measures should be incorporated into SEIR models to improve forecasts of COVID-19 infections. Utilising IS to analyse the spread of digital information via social media platforms can inform efforts to combat the pandemic and infodemic. Agencies responsible for infection and disease control, policy makers, businesses, institutions and educators must accurately monitor infection rates to appropriately allocate funding and human resources and develop effective disease prevention marketing campaigns.},

Considering social tie strength in a herd behavior context, the analysis of sufficient configurations for click- and view-through intentions provides a nuanced perspective on social media user behavior and social influence. For instance, click-through intention requires observing a “like” from a close person, while view-through intentions can also develop after observing “likes” from less close acquaintances, yet in the last case only if the user assumes the acquaintance is better informed regarding the sponsored content. In addition, a “like” from a close friend deemed better informed can even make a user click on a sponsored content that was not considered valuable before.},

A thinker function was fulfilled where bloggers expressed opinions, especially on government response. An additional function not previously delineated was identified, which might be termed emotive or therapeutic. In addition, several of the blog functions indicate the role the Internet plays in maintaining a sense of community in times of crisis.},

This study provides an exhaustive comparison of sentiment analysis methods, using a validation set of Dutch economic headlines to compare the performance of manual annotation, crowd coding, numerous dictionaries and machine learning using both traditional and deep learning algorithms. The three main conclusions of this article are that: (1) The best performance is still attained with trained human or crowd coding; (2) None of the used dictionaries come close to acceptable levels of validity; and (3) machine learning, especially deep learning, substantially outperforms dictionary-based methods but falls short of human performance. From these findings, we stress the importance of always validating automatic text analysis methods before usage. Moreover, we provide a recommended step-by-step approach for (automated) text analysis projects to ensure both efficiency and validity.},

	abstract = {In January 2021, the users of subreddit r/wallstreetbets (WSB) triggered an unprecedented short squeeze by driving up GameStop’s stock price to an unimaginable high point. During the event, a large number of users participated in the discussion about GameStop and coordinated trading behavior on r/WSB to push the stock price higher. In this article, we investigate the characteristics of the collective behaviors and social dynamics from the evolutions of topological structure, discussed topics, and user sentiment polarity (SP) by constructing dynamic interaction networks, modeling the topic, and analyzing the user sentiment. We find that the topological structure of the interaction network evolves toward a more efficient direction, the discussed topics change more centralized, and the user sentiment tends to be more positive and divergent. And we reveal that part of GameStop’s stock price is explained by the social media activity, popularity of the dominant topic, topic cohesiveness, SP of users, and sentiment divergence between interacted users on r/WSB. Our work quantitatively characterizes the interaction networks and user behavior during the GameStop short squeeze and provides an example to analyze the event which synchronously evolves in the physical space and cyberspace. It not only contributes to the analysis of social system behavior and structure but also provides valuable insights into the financial practice and policy decision-making.},

In this paper, we examine whether sentiment occurring in social media content is associated with a user's information sharing behavior. We carry out our research in the context of political communication on Twitter. Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones. As a practical implication, companies should pay more attention to the analysis of sentiment related to their brands and products in social media communication as well as in designing advertising content that triggers emotions.},

The one-hour response and one-day response did not show differential effects on trust towards the hospital. The effect of timing was mediated by perceived credibility of the crisis response. In addition, the emotional appeal triggered greater trust, perception of reputation, and intention to “like” the post; whereas the rational appeal elicited greater intention to share and comment on the post.

We test a research model to examine major determinants of message spread during the 2016 Charlotte, North Carolina protests which occurred after false online rumors spread related to the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. We hypothesize relationships between message spread (retweets) and extremity, negative emotions (sadness and fear), and social ties (reciprocal reply and location proximity), and Twitter experience. Using Poisson regression, we evaluate and compare two separate models (rumor and truth). Results of the analysis indicate that rumors and truths spread differently. More extreme messages spread less if they are truths, and fear does not relate to the spread of rumors.

Further, we developed a method to extract demographic information from the subreddits, examined how the post authors’ self-disclosures reflect the unique communities in which their posts are shared, and discussed how the authors’ language use choices might be related to broader social patterns. We observed some differences between the subreddits in terms of word frequency, demographics disclosure, and gendered language. In general, both subreddits had more female posters than male, and posters tended to use more words about their opposite gender than the same. Gender-diverse posters were uncommon. Implications for future research include a more careful, inclusive focus on identity and disclosure and how that interacts with advice-seeking behavior in online communities.},

First, the authors conduct a preliminary study to identify sets of more and less annoying ads. Second, in a field experiment, they calculate the compensating differential, that is, the amount of money a publisher would need to pay users to generate the same number of impressions in the presence of annoying ads as it would generate in their absence. Third, the authors conduct a mouse-tracking study to investigate how annoying ads affect reading processes. They conclude that in plausible scenarios, the practice of running annoying ads can cost more money than it earns.},

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

            Due to the considerable growth of the volume of text documents on the Internet and in digital libraries, manual analysis of these documents is no longer feasible. Having efficient approaches to keyword extraction in order to retrieve the ‘key’ elements of the studied documents is now a necessity. Keyword extraction has been an active research field for many years, covering various applications in Text Mining, Information Retrieval, and Natural Language Processing, and meeting different requirements. However, it is not a unified domain of research. In spite of the existence of many approaches in the field, there is no single approach that effectively extracts keywords from different data sources. This shows the importance of having a comprehensive review, which discusses the complexity of the task and categorizes the main approaches of the field based on the features and methods of extraction that they use. This paper presents a general introduction to the field of keyword/keyphrase extraction. Unlike the existing surveys, different aspects of the problem along with the main challenges in the field are discussed. This mainly includes the unclear definition of ‘keyness’, complexities of targeting proper features for capturing desired keyness properties and selecting efficient extraction methods, and also the evaluation issues. By classifying a broad range of state-of-the-art approaches and analysing the benefits and drawbacks of different features and methods, we provide a clearer picture of them. This review is intended to help readers find their way around all the works related to keyword extraction and guide them in choosing or designing a method that is appropriate for the application they are targeting.},

	abstract = {A document’s keywords provide high-level descriptions of the content that summarize the document’s central themes, concepts, ideas, or arguments. These descriptive phrases make it easier for algorithms to find relevant information quickly and efficiently. It plays a vital role in document processing, such as indexing, classification, clustering, and summarization. Traditional keyword extraction approaches rely on statistical distributions of key terms in a document for the most part. According to contemporary technological breakthroughs, contextual information is critical in deciding the semantics of the work at hand. Similarly, context-based features may be beneficial in the job of keyword extraction. For example, simply indicating the previous or next word of the phrase of interest might be used to describe the context of a phrase. This research presents several experiments to validate that context-based key extraction is significant compared to traditional methods. Additionally, the KeyBERT proposed methodology also results in improved results. The proposed work relies on identifying a group of important words or phrases from the document’s content that can reflect the authors’ main ideas, concepts, or arguments. It also uses contextual word embedding to extract keywords. Finally, the findings are compared to those obtained using older approaches such as Text Rank, Rake, Gensim, Yake, and TF-IDF. The Journals of Universal Computer (JUCS) dataset was employed in our research. Only data from abstracts were used to produce keywords for the research article, and the KeyBERT model outperformed traditional approaches in producing similar keywords to the authors’ provided keywords. The average similarity of our approach with author-assigned keywords is 51\%.},

This study aims to analyze an approach to infer sponsored content in videos from top digital influencers on YouTube using knowledge acquisition techniques in audio transcriptions. A dataset with 34,563 videos, among 103 different YouTubers channels, was used in a model comprising six stages: data acquisition, preprocessing of documents, identification of candidate videos, manual transcriptions processing, automatic transcriptions processing, and tuple filtering. Despite we perceived several difficulties during the recognition of speech from YouTube videos, such as the absence of clear boundaries between words, the presence of two or more people talking in the video, and colloquial expressions, as a result, the approach identifies sponsored videos from their audio transcripts in a feasible process by identifying keywords, obtaining knowledge from tuples, and recognizing named entities.},

For over two decades, researchers have studied television video ads by analyzing the hand-coded data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project and its successor, the Wesleyan Media Project (WMP). Unfortunately, manually coding more than a hundred of variables, such as issue mentions, opponent appearance, and negativity, for many videos is a laborious and expensive process. We propose to automatically code campaign advertisement videos. Applying state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we extract various audio and image features from each video file. We show that our machine coding is comparable to human coding for many variables of the WMP datasets. Since many candidates make their advertisement videos available on the Internet, automated coding can dramatically improve the efficiency and scope of campaign advertisement research. Open-source software package is available for implementing the proposed methodology.},

	abstract = {Introduction YouTube is a popular social media used by youth and has electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) content. We used machine learning to identify the content of e-cigarette videos, featured e-cigarette products, video uploaders, and marketing and sales of e-cigarette products.
Methods We identified e-cigarette content using 18 search terms (eg, e-cig) using fictitious youth viewer profiles and predicted four models using the metadata as the input to supervised machine learning: (1) video themes, (2) featured e-cigarette products, (3) channel type (ie, video uploaders) and (4) discount/sales. We assessed the association between engagement data and the four models.
Results 3830 English videos were included in the supervised machine learning. The most common video theme was ‘product review’ (48.9\%), followed by ‘instruction’ (eg, ‘how to’ use/modify e-cigarettes; 17.3\%); diverse e-cigarette products were featured; ‘vape enthusiasts’ most frequently posted e-cigarette videos (54.0\%), followed by retailers (20.3\%); 43.2\% of videos had discount/sales of e-cigarettes; and the most common sales strategy was external links for purchasing (34.1\%). ‘Vape trick’ was the least common theme but had the highest engagement (eg, {\textgreater}2 million views). ‘Cannabis’ (53.9\%) and ‘instruction’ (49.9\%) themes were more likely to have external links for purchasing (p{\textless}0.001). The four models achieved an F1 score (a measure of model accuracy) of up to 0.87.
Discussion Our findings indicate that on YouTube videos accessible to youth, a variety of e-cigarette products are featured through diverse videos themes, with discount/sales. The findings highlight the need to regulate the promotion of e-cigarettes on social media platforms.},

This model has been challenged in recent years due to competitive and political pressures on platforms. In this paper, we use YouTube as a case to understand how processes of commodification are changing on digital platforms. We demonstrate that YouTube furthers the commodification of content, audiences and creative labour by cultivating commercial interactions, standardising exchange mechanisms and constructing systems of trust. The platform enables producers and retailers to sell digital and physical goods to users, advertisers to capture audiences’ interest and brands to establish partnerships with producers. In sum, we show how YouTube not only monetises attention but commodifies all forms of engagement through its marketplaces with consequences for the precarity of users and producers on the platform.},

This paper is the first comparative measurement study that explores how advertisement exposure and content vary across child-oriented videos on YouTube. We do this by conducting a cross-regional advertisement analysis on highly viewed "made for kids" labelled content across a total of ten countries with varying regulation. A second front of comparison is carried out between ad patterns on unlabelled and labelled child-oriented videos. Our analysis reveals that the safety of a child's YouTube experience is shaped significantly by their external environment. There also appears to be lax enforcement of YouTube ad and child protection policies, indicated by the presence of unlabelled child-oriented content with weak ad regulation. We discuss the implications of inappropriate exposure on children and suggest policy and implementation measures to mitigate this threat.},

In this work, we implemented a computational framework for the predictive analysis of the content-based features extracted from advertisement video files and various effectiveness metrics to aid the design and production processes of commercial advertisements. Our proposed predictive analysis framework extracts multi-dimensional temporal patterns from the content of advertisement videos using multimedia signal processing and natural language processing tools. The pattern analysis part employs an architecture of cross modality feature learning where data streams from different feature dimensions are employed to train separate neural network models and then these models are fused together to learn a shared representation. Subsequently, a neural network model trained on this joint representation is utilized as a classifier for predicting advertisement effectiveness. Based on the predictive patterns identified between the content features and the effectiveness metrics of advertisements, we have elicited a useful set of auditory, visual and textual patterns that is strongly correlated with the proposed effectiveness metrics while can be readily implemented in the design and production processes of commercial advertisements. We validate our approach using subjective ratings from a dedicated user study, the text sentiment strength of online viewer comments, and a viewer opinion metric of the likes/views ratio of each advertisement from YouTube video-sharing website.},

Respondents in this study are millennials who are in Batam City and surrounding areas with an age range of 18–35 years chosen using the non-probability sampling method. This study uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the SmartPLS. YouTube Advertising influences brand awareness and brand image, whereas brand awareness and brand image do not affect purchase intention. YouTube ads are directly related to the purchase intention. Brand awareness and brand image are not mediating variables because they are not associated with purchase intention.},

	abstract = {Background: Unhealthy food marketing to children is a key risk factor for childhood obesity. Online video platforms have surpassed television as the primary choice for screen viewing among children but the extent of food marketing through such media is relatively unknown. We aimed to examine food and beverage advertisements (ads) encountered in YouTube videos targeting children in Malaysia.
Methods: The social media analytics site SocialBlade.com was used to identify the most popular YouTube videos (n = 250) targeting children. Ads encountered while viewing these videos were recorded and analyzed for type of product promoted and ad format (video vs. overlay). Food and beverage ads were further coded based on food category and persuasive marketing techniques used.
Results: In total 187 ads were encountered in sampled videos. Food and beverage ads were the most common at 38\% (n=71), among which 56.3\% (n = 40) promoted noncore foods. Ads for noncore foods were more commonly delivered as video rather than overlay ads. Among ads promoting noncore foods, the most commonly employed persuasive marketing techniques found were taste appeal (42.3\%), uniqueness/novelty (32.4\%), the use of animation (22.5\%), fun appeal (22.5\%), use of promotional characters (15.5\%), price (12.7\%), and health and nutrition benefits (8.5\%).
Conclusions: Similar to television, unhealthy food ads predominate in content aimed toward children on YouTube. Policies regulating food marketing to children need to be extended to cover online content in line with a rapidly-evolving digital media environment. Service providers of social media can play a part in limiting unhealthy food advertising to children.},

	abstract = {Purpose YouTube's vast and engaged user base makes it central to firms' digital marketing effort. With extant studies focusing on viewers' post-view engagement behavior, however, research into what motivates viewers to click on and watch YouTube videos is scarce. This study investigates the implications of marketers' video optimization practices for video views on YouTube. Design/methodology/approach The study employed a data set of videos (N = 4,398) gathered by scraping YouTube's trending list. Using a combination of text and sentiment analysis, the study measured four video optimization practices: information content of video titles, emotional intensity of video titles, information content of video descriptions and volume of video tags. It then analyzed the effect of these video optimization practices on video views. Findings The study finds that greater availability of information in video titles is negatively associated with video views, whereas intensity of negative emotional sentiment in video titles is positively associated with video views. Further, greater availability of information in video descriptions is positively associated with video views. Finally, an inverted U-shaped relationship is found between volume of video tags and video views. Up to 17 video tags can contribute to more video views; however, beyond 17 tags, the relationship turns negative. Originality/value This study investigates the effect of marketers' video optimization practices on video views. While extant studies mainly focus on viewers' post-view engagement behavior, such as liking, commenting on and sharing videos, this study examines video views. Similarly, extant studies investigate videos' internal content, while this study investigates elements of the video metadata.},

	abstract = {Firms’ public communication on social media during disasters can benefit both disaster response efficiency and the perception of the corporate image. Despite its importance, limited guidelines are available to inform firms’ disaster communication strategies. The current study examines firms’ communication on social media in various disasters and how it impacts public engagement. We employ a novel natural language processing (NLP) approach, Semantic Projection with Active Retrieval (SPAR), to analyze Facebook posts made by Russell 3000 firms between 2009 and 2022 concerning various disasters. We show that firm communication can be measured based on two dimensions derived from the Competing Values Framework (CVF): internal versus external and stable versus flexible. We find that social media messages that emphasize operational continuity (internal/stable-oriented) are more popular during biological disasters. By contrast, messages that stress innovations and adaptations to disasters (external/flexible-oriented) elicit more engagement in weather-related disasters. The study offers a framework to characterize and guide firms’ design of disaster communication on social media in different disaster contexts. Our SPAR method is also available to firms to analyze their social media data and uncover the underlying patterns in communication across different contexts.

            Large firms are leaders in disaster response and communication. We study how firms communicate on social media during various disasters and the relationship between their communication and public engagement using a computationally intensive theory construction framework. The framework incorporates a novel natural language processing (NLP) approach, Semantic Projection with Active Retrieval (SPAR), as a key component of the method lexicon. Drawing on the two dimensions (internal versus external and stable versus flexible) of the Competing Values Framework (CVF) as our theoretical lexicon, we examine Facebook posts of Russell 3000 firms on multiple disasters between 2009 and 2022. We find that social media messages that are internal- and stable-oriented, or emphasize operational continuity, are more likely to elicit engagement from the public during biological disasters. By contrast, messages that are external- and flexible-oriented, or stress the innovations to adapt to the disaster, induce more engagement in weather-related disasters. The study offers theoretical implications and methodological support for the research and design of social media messages in disasters and other contexts.

            In this study, we analyzed social media conversations during the unfolding of the FTX crisis, the biggest cryptocurrency scandal in United States history. Drawing on the accessibility‐diagnosticity framework, we examined the negative spillover effect of the crisis using a natural language processing approach. We specifically assessed whether there was a negative spillover from FTX to other crypto entities with different levels of diagnostic attribute similarity. We collected a large corpus of Twitter conversations related to the FTX collapse in 2022 and used the association rule analysis to determine the association between FTX and other crypto entities. Our analysis revealed that the number of tweets mentioning FTX and other crypto entities changed in line with a series of real‐world events during the FTX crisis. The negative spillover of the FTX crisis occurred primarily during the first 10 days as the FTX scandal unfolded. The results indicated that the FTX crisis spilled over to highly accessible and diagnostic crypto entities, such as Binance, Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency industry in general. On the other hand, less accessible and less diagnostic crypto entities/currencies like Ethereum and Coinbase did not experience negative spillover from the scandal.},

Taking a cognitive science perspective, a systematic account is presented of the cognitive structures that underlie a wide range of different emotions. Detailed proposals about the factors that affect intensity are also offered. The authors propose three broad classes of emotions, each corresponding to a different attentional focus. One class consists of reactions to events, one of reactions to the actions of agents, and one of reactions to objects.

	abstract = {Purpose
              Emotion plays a significant role in both institutional and individual investors’ decision-making process. Emotions affect the perception of risk and the assessment of monetary value. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence available that addresses how investors’ emotions affect commodity market returns. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether media-based emotions can be used to predict future commodity returns.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              The authors examine the short-term predictive power of media-based emotion indices on the following five days’ commodity returns. The research adopts a proprietary data set of commodity-specific market emotions, which is computed based on a comprehensive textual analysis of sources from newswires, internet news sources and social media. Time series econometrics models (threshold generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity and vector autoregressive) are employed to analyze 14 years (January 1998-December 2011) of daily observations of the CRB commodity market index, crude oil and gold returns, and the market-level sentiments and emotions (optimism, fear and joy).
            
            
              Findings
              The empirical results suggest that the commodity-specific emotions (optimism, fear and joy) have significant influence on individual commodity returns, but not on commodity market index returns. Additionally, the research findings support the short-term predictability of the commodity-specific emotions on the following five days’ individual commodity returns. Compared to the previous studies of news sentiment on commodity returns (Borovkova, 2011; Borovkova and Mahakena, 2015; Smales, 2014), this research provides further evidence of the effects of news and social media-based emotions (optimism, fear and joy) in the commodity market. Additionally, this work proposes that market emotion incorporates both a sentimental effect and appraisal effect on commodity returns. Empirical results are shown to support both the sentimental effect and appraisal effect when market sentiment is controlled in crude oil and gold spot markets.
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper adopts the valence-arousal approach and cognitive appraisal approach to explain financial anomalies caused by investors’ emotions. Additionally, this is the first paper to explore the predictive power of investors’ emotions (optimism, fear and joy) on commodity returns.},

	abstract = {Introduction
              The psychological well-being of individuals has become an essential issue during the global pandemic. As a pervasive activity for individuals to pull through COVID-19, social media use may play a role in psychological well-being. Drawing on the transactional model of stress and coping, the current study investigated the relationships between COVID-19-related stressors and the use of social media to facilitate specific coping strategies. We further investigated how social media coping strategies impact users’ psychological adjustment.
            
            
              Methods
              We collected the data from 641 quarantined residents through a two-wave survey that was conducted in two cities in China during government-mandated lockdowns.
            
            
              Results
              The results showed that perceived COVID-19 stress was related to the intensity of social media use for problem-focused coping, socioemotional coping, and mental disengagement. In addition, individuals’ psychological adjustment was positively associated with social media use for socioemotional coping and mental disengagement while negatively related to problem-focused coping. Age was also found to be a moderator of the relationship between socioemotional coping and psychological adjustment.
            
            
              Discussion
              To relieve pandemic-related stress, individuals can actively utilize social media to implement various coping strategies. However, coping activities with social media may not always induce psychological benefits. By revealing the different levels of psychological adjustment among social media users with specific coping strategies, the current research enriched the literature on the effects of social media use on mental health. Findings from this study suggest the need for the prudent use of social media to cope with public health crises.},

            Given the pervasive spread and use of the Internet and social media, consumer use of these new forums for expressing their revenge intentions has also increased. This research examines the impacts of service outcome and service process failures on consumer online revenge intentions. Using insights from cognitive appraisal theory, a comprehensive model is developed and tested to examine the impacts of service failure types on consumers’ primary and secondary appraisal processes that lead to online revenge intentions. The model was tested in the United Kingdom and Jordan. Results show that for the two countries, different service failure types lead to different cognitive appraisal processes, and to intentions to use different online revenge platforms.},

Presumably, such information exchange could improve decision making and provide instrumental benefits to the participants. However, to benefit from the information access provided by online social media, the participant will have to overcome the allure of homophily—which refers to the propensity to seek interactions with others of similar status (e.g., religion, education, income, occupation) or values (e.g., attitudes, beliefs, and aspirations). This research assesses the extent to which social media participants exhibit homophily (versus heterophily) in a unique context—virtual investment communities (VICs). We study the propensity of investors in seeking interactions with others with similar sentiments in VICs and identify theoretically important and meaningful conditions under which homophily is attenuated. To address this question, we used a discrete choice model to analyze 682,781 messages on Yahoo! Finance message boards for 29 Dow Jones stocks and assess how investors select a particular thread to respond. Our results revealed that, despite the benefits from heterophily, investors are not immune to the allure of homophily in interactions in VICs. The tendency to exhibit homophily is attenuated by an investor’s experience in VICs, the amount of information in the thread, but amplified by stock volatility. The paper discusses important implications for practice.},

            Complex networks have been successfully used to describe the spread of diseases in populations of interacting individuals. Conversely, pairwise interactions are often not enough to characterize social contagion processes such as opinion formation or the adoption of novelties, where complex mechanisms of influence and reinforcement are at work. Here we introduce a higher-order model of social contagion in which a social system is represented by a simplicial complex and contagion can occur through interactions in groups of different sizes. Numerical simulations of the model on both empirical and synthetic simplicial complexes highlight the emergence of novel phenomena such as a discontinuous transition induced by higher-order interactions. We show analytically that the transition is discontinuous and that a bistable region appears where healthy and endemic states co-exist. Our results help explain why critical masses are required to initiate social changes and contribute to the understanding of higher-order interactions in complex systems.},

              Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008)
              BMJ
              337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.},

	abstract = {This study examines the impact of news content sentiment on digital news readership and social media sharing. Using econometric analyses and models estimated with rich clickstream data on online news readership and social media sharing data collected from Twitter, we find a differential effect of sentiment on news readership and sharing behaviors. Specifically, individuals are likely to read news articles with negative headline sentiment on the news website but tend to share articles with positive article sentiment on Twitter. Upon decomposition of news article sentiment, we find a contrasting positive author sentiment effect and a negative news topic valence effect on news readership. Interestingly, we uncover that an increase in a Twitter user’s followers leads to an increase in the Twitter user’s propensity to share positive-sentiment news articles. Overall, our findings affirm the coopetitive but complementary relationship between news websites and social media platforms. Our results also guide publishers to better craft their news content and manage social media presence to improve audience engagement and readership outcomes while preserving the agenda-setting ability of news media. Importantly, given the dichotomy between news reading and sharing behaviors, predicting individual behaviors based on social media opinions may need to be viewed with prudence.
          , 
            Although social media has helped online newspapers by allowing users to organically share articles, some have argued that it has cannibalized and hurt newspapers through reduced readership and diminished agenda-setting power. Motivated by these two opposing effects, it is critical to understand what affects the duality between sharing news articles on social media and reading the articles on news websites. Using rich clickstream data on online news readership obtained from an English-language newspaper in an Asian country and social media data collected from Twitter, we focus on article sentiment as a key news content attribute and find a differential effect of sentiment on readership and sharing behaviors across the news site and third-party social media platform. Our results show that people are likely to read news articles with negative sentiment on the news site, but they tend to share articles with positive sentiment on Twitter. Specifically, a one-unit increase in content sentiment is associated with a 10.86\% or 273-unit decrease in news site page views but a 17.0\% or 2.10-unit increase in Twitter sharing volume. Upon decomposition of news article sentiment, we also find a contrasting positive author sentiment effect and a negative news topic valence effect on news readership. To uncover the underlying mechanism of the findings, we test the key intuitions from prior self-presentation literature. We find that an increase in a Twitter user’s followers (i.e., audience size) leads to an increase in the Twitter user’s propensity to share positive-sentiment news articles. Our findings on the role of sentiment on content consumption and sharing affirm the coopetitive but complementary relationship between news websites and social media platforms. Our results also guide publishers to better craft their news content and manage social media presence to improve audience engagement and readership outcomes while preserving the agenda-setting ability of news media.

	abstract = {Most studies analyzing political traffic on Social Networks focus on a single platform, while campaigns and reactions to political events produce interactions across different social media. Ignoring such cross-platform traffic may lead to analytical errors, missing important interactions across social media that e.g. explain the cause of trending or viral discussions. This work links Twitter and YouTube social networks using cross-postings of video URLs on Twitter to discover the main tendencies and preferences of the electorate, distinguish users and communities’ favouritism towards an ideology or candidate, study the sentiment towards candidates and political events, and measure political homophily. This study shows that Twitter communities correlate with YouTube comment communities: that is, Twitter users belonging to the same community in the Retweet graph tend to post YouTube video links with comments from YouTube users belonging to the same community in the YouTube Comment graph. Specifically, we identify Twitter and YouTube communities, we measure their similarity and differences and show the interactions and the correlation between the largest communities on YouTube and Twitter. To achieve that, we have gather a dataset of approximately 20M tweets and the comments of 29K YouTube videos; we present the volume, the sentiment, and the communities formed in YouTube and Twitter graphs, and publish a representative sample of the dataset, as allowed by the corresponding Twitter policy restrictions.},

            The emotional contagion of netizens is an important factor that accelerates the spread of rumors, and it is also key to the effectiveness of rumor refutation. Based on the existing emotional model, we improved the method for calculating the emotional value and the transformation rules to simulate how the infection transforms individual emotion to group emotion during rumor refutation. The results show that the cycle and trend of netizen emotional change vary by period, but the final distribution structure presents a relatively stable state. The factors that affect the emotional changes of netizens are mainly objective and subjective aspects, both of which can promote the evolution of emotional contagion. The objective aspect depends on the speed and credibility of the rumor, and the subjective aspect depends on the degree of intimacy between netizens. After rumor refutation, emotions generally change from negative emotions to positive or immune emotions.},

	abstract = {Social interactions can trigger emotional contagion between individuals resulting in behavioral synchrony. Emotional contagion can be a very effective and attractive strategy in communication and advertising, and understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional contagion can help marketers to improve their commercial approaches or develop better ones. The purpose of this study is to review and classify the various methodologies and theoretical approaches on emotional contagion, identify the best practices in this domain, and identify ways of gaging and measuring emotional contagion. The study is based on a mini literature review. We identify different mechanisms and approaches to emotional contagion described in the literature. Emotional contagion can be triggered by facial expressions, indirect human interactions, and/or by observing other people's behavior in direct and indirect interactions. Furthermore, emotional contagion can be triggered physiologically or neurologically by synchronizing with the emotional state of others during human interactions. Regarding the assessment and measurement of emotional contagion, we argue that methods based on neuroscience tools are much more accurate and effective than methods based on traditional research approaches. The study identifies guidelines for research on commercial communication through emotional contagion that can be especially interesting for academia and marketing practitioners. The findings are important for field marketers interested in developing new individualized approaches in their commercial strategies and marketing in general. In addition, the study can become the basis of research that further refines and compares the efficacy of the various techniques and tools involved.},

            Social media technologies (SMTs) are routinely identified as a strong and pervasive threat to digital well-being (DWB). Extended screen time sessions, chronic distractions via notifications, and fragmented workflows have all been blamed on how these technologies ruthlessly undermine our ability to exercise quintessential human faculties. One reason SMTs can do this is because they powerfully affect our emotions. Nevertheless, (1) how social media technology affects our emotional life and (2) how these emotions relate to our digital well-being remain unexplored. Remedying this is important because ethical insights into (1) and (2) open the possibility of designing for social media technologies in ways that actively reinforce our digital well-being. In this article, we examine the way social media technologies facilitate online emotions because of emotional affordances. This has important implications for evaluating the ethical implications of today’s social media platforms, as well as for how we design future ones.},

            Black-box optimization (BBO) algorithms are widely employed by practitioners to address computationally expensive real-world problems such as automatic tuning of machine learning models and evacuation route planning. The Nelder–Mead (NM) method is a well-known local search heuristic for BBO that has been applied to solve many real-world problems from way back because of its promising performance. However, this method has a strong dependence on initialization due to its local search tendency. Nevertheless, a discussion on the proper initialization of the NM method is limited to the recent study by Wessing (Optim Lett 13(4):847–856, 2019), which is solely based on an analysis using the simple sphere function. In this study, we take a further step to improve Wessing’s result by massively investigating how the initialization affects the search performance in views of the initial simplex size and shape and a constraint handling method that is employed on 24 BBO benchmarking problems. Based on the numerical results, we present the empirical best practice for the initialization of the NM method for cases involving a limited evaluation budget.},

Viruses belonging to Groups 3 and 4 can cause severe human disease and hazard to workers, as well as a spreading risk to the community. However, there is no effective prophylaxis or treatment available for Group 4 viruses. European trade unions and the Commission are negotiating the classification of the COVID-19 virus along these 2 categories. This article weighs the reasons to classify it in Group 3 or 4 while comparing its risks to those of the most significant viruses classified in these 2 categories. COVID-19 characteristics justify its classification in Group 4. Contaminated workers in contact with the public play an important role in disseminating the virus. In hospitals and nursing homes, they increase the overall case fatality rate. By strongly protecting these workers and professionals, the European Union would not only improve health in work environments, but also activate a mechanism key to reducing the COVID-19 burden in the general population. Admittedly, the availability of a new vaccine or treatment would change this conclusion, which was reached in the middle of the first pandemic.},

            Social media users face a tension between presenting themselves in an idealized or authentic way. Here, we explore how prioritizing one over the other impacts users’ well-being. We estimate the degree of self-idealized vs. authentic self-expression as the proximity between a user’s self-reported personality and the automated personality judgements made on the basis Facebook Likes and status updates. Analyzing data of 10,560 Facebook users, we find that individuals who are more authentic in their self-expression also report greater Life Satisfaction. This effect appears consistent across different personality profiles, countering the proposition that individuals with socially desirable personalities benefit from authentic self-expression more than others. We extend this finding in a pre-registered, longitudinal experiment, demonstrating the causal relationship between authentic posting and positive affect and mood on a within-person level. Our findings suggest that the extent to which social media use is related to well-being depends on how individuals use it.},

A questionnaire study was conducted among Turkish participants (

Additionally, perception of threat was associated with less support through negative emotions when perceived descriptive norms were strong. Further, perceived injunctive norms were associated with more support to Syrian refugees, but less so when people had stronger negative emotions. These findings suggest that with negative descriptive norms, threat‐based negative emotions are associated with less support to Syrian refugees, and that stronger negative emotions make the association between positive injunctive norms and support weaker.},

However, few studies link emotions specifically to how people debate political issues and seek political information online. In this article, we examine how anger and fear are related to politics-oriented digital behavior, attempting to bridge the gap between the thus far disconnected literature on political psychology and the digital media. Based on survey data, we show that anger and fear are connected to distinct behaviors online. Angry people are more likely to engage in debates with people having both similar and opposing views. They also seek out information confirming their views more frequently. Anxious individuals, by contrast, tend to seek out information contradicting their opinions. These findings reiterate predictions made in the extant literature concerning the role of emotions in politics. Thus, we argue that anger reinforces echo chamber dynamics and trench warfare dynamics in the digital public sphere, while fear counteracts these dynamics.},

            We explore the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and the formation of echo chambers. To assess the different dynamics, we perform a comparative analysis on more than 100 million pieces of content concerning controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. The analysis focuses on two main dimensions: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation in homophilic clusters of users dominates online dynamics. However, a direct comparison of news consumption on Facebook and Reddit shows higher segregation on Facebook.

            Social media may limit the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative, that is, echo chambers. However, the interaction paradigms among users and feed algorithms greatly vary across social media platforms. This paper explores the key differences between the main social media platforms and how they are likely to influence information spreading and echo chambers’ formation. We perform a comparative analysis of more than 100 million pieces of content concerning several controversial topics (e.g., gun control, vaccination, abortion) from Gab, Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. We quantify echo chambers over social media by two main ingredients: 1) homophily in the interaction networks and 2) bias in the information diffusion toward like-minded peers. Our results show that the aggregation of users in homophilic clusters dominate online interactions on Facebook and Twitter. We conclude the paper by directly comparing news consumption on Facebook and Reddit, finding higher segregation on Facebook.},

Drawing on data collected in March 2016 among 1201 young Dutch users (15–25 years), we found that positive expressions were generally perceived as more appropriate than negative expressions across all platforms. In line with the objective of the study, some platform differences were found. The expression of negative emotions was rated as most appropriate for WhatsApp, followed by Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. For positive emotion expression, perceived appropriateness was highest for WhatsApp, followed by Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Additionally, some gender differences were found, while age showed little variations. Overall, the results contribute to a more informed understanding of emotion expression online.},

This introduction to the special issue on political influencers provides a definition of what makes someone a political influencer. It theoretically locates political influencers within the larger field of media and communication scholarship, and delineates the term from other, related concepts such as that of opinion leader. Building on eight contributions focused across more than six countries and nine platforms, the article showcases important strands of current and future research. It provides the foundation for a more systemic understanding of political influencers on social media, situating them within a media ecology complicated by a diverse array of traditional and nontraditional actors, tactics, and dynamics.

We explore the transmission dynamics of the developed model using numerical simulations with different parameter settings, which characterize different levels of heterogeneity. The results show that when the reproductive number, R0, is larger than one, a low level of heterogeneity results in dynamics similar to those predicted by the homogeneous mixing model. As the level of heterogeneity increases, the dynamics become more different. As a test case, we calibrated the model with the case incidence data for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing in 2003, and the estimated parameters demonstrated the effectiveness of the control measures taken during that period.},

Additionally, the principles underlying Agenda 2030, including the need for inclusive multi-stakeholder approaches; partnerships, accountability (through open monitoring and reporting) and the imperative to 'leave no-one behind' provide important entry points for media actors to engage with broader development interventions for enhanced impact. International actors can help promote this by supporting media development, including encouraging national media actors to engage with such processes.},

To define collective well-being as a group-level construct measured across 5 domains (vitality, opportunity, connectedness, contribution, and inspiration) and introduce an actionable model that demonstrates how community characteristics affect collective well-being. To review the literature describing each domain?s association with health outcomes and community characteristics? associations with collective well-being.Methods:We came to consensus on topics describing each component of our conceptual model. Because ?well-being? is not indexed in MEDLINE, we performed topic-specific database searches and examined bibliographies of papers retrieved. We excluded articles that were limited to narrow subtopics or studies within small subpopulations. Preference was given to quasi-experimental or randomized studies, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses. Consensus was reached on inclusion or exclusion of all articles.Results:Reviewed literature supported each of the proposed domains as important aspects of collective well-being and as determinants of individual or community health. Evidence suggests a broad range of community characteristics support collective well-being.Conclusions:The health and quality of life of a community may be improved by focusing efforts on community characteristics that support key aspects of well-being. Future work should develop a unified measure of collective well-being to evaluate the relative impact of specific efforts on the collective well-being of communities.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Social media have become an integral part of our lives, expanding our interlinking capabilities to new levels. There is plenty to be said about their positive effects. On the other hand, however, some serious negative implications of social media have been repeatedly highlighted in recent years, pointing at various threats to society and its more vulnerable members, such as teenagers, in particular, ranging from much-discussed problems such as digital addiction and polarization to manipulative influences of algorithms and further to more teenager-specific issues (e.g., body stereotyping). The impact of social media—both at an individual and societal level—is characterized by the complex interplay between the users' interactions and the intelligent components of the platform. Thus, users' understanding of social media mechanisms plays a determinant role. We thus propose a theoretical framework based on an adaptive “{\textless}italic{\textgreater}Social Media Virtual Companion{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}” for educating and supporting an entire community, teenage students, to interact in social media environments in order to achieve desirable conditions, defined in terms of a community-specific and participatory designed measure of Collective Well-Being (CWB). This Companion combines automatic processing with expert intervention and guidance. The virtual Companion will be powered by a {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Recommender System{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}CWB-RS{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}) that will optimize a {\textless}italic{\textgreater}CWB{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} metric instead of engagement or platform profit, which currently largely drives recommender systems thereby disregarding any societal collateral effect. CWB-RS will optimize CWB both in the short term by balancing the level of social media threats the users are exposed to, and in the long term by adopting an {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Intelligent Tutor System{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} role and enabling adaptive and personalized sequencing of playful learning activities. We put an emphasis on {\textless}italic{\textgreater}experts{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} and {\textless}italic{\textgreater}educators{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} in the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}educationally managed social media community{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} of the Companion. They play five key roles: (a) use the Companion in classroom-based educational activities; (b) guide the definition of the CWB; (c) provide a hierarchical structure of learning strategies, objectives and activities that will support and contain the adaptive sequencing algorithms of the CWB-RS based on hierarchical reinforcement learning; (d) act as moderators of direct conflicts between the members of the community; and, finally, (e) monitor and address ethical and educational issues that are beyond the intelligent agent's competence and control. This framework offers a possible approach to understanding how to design social media systems and embedded educational interventions that favor a more healthy and positive society. Preliminary results on the performance of the Companion's components and studies of the educational and psychological underlying principles are presented.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Travel location recommendation systems have long been used by travellers for their ability to suggest destinations and potential travel experiences that match travellers' desires. Recently, a new type of domestic travel has emerged, namely domestic overseas-like travel experiences. These experiences are attractive to travellers who have a preference for exotic locations but no desire to travel internationally. Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users.},

	abstract = {Businesses and industries are placing a greater emphasis on information systems for cybersecurity decision-making due to the rising cybersecurity threat landscape and the critical need to protect their digital assets. Threat hunting provides a data-driven and proactive approach to cybersecurity, enabling organizations to efficiently detect, analyze, and respond to cyber threats in real-time. Despite playing a crucial role, these systems face several obstacles, including the manual analysis of technical threat intelligence, the non-Gaussian nature of real-world data, the high rate of false positives produced during threat hunting, and the lack of interpretation and justification for these complex models. This article adopts the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel IT artifact for threat-hunting named DeepSecure. First, to automatically extract latent patterns from multivariate time series datasets, we propose a dynamic vector quantized variational autoencoder technique. Second, a multiscale hierarchical attention bi-directional gated recurrent unit-based threat-hunting mechanism is designed. Finally, we provide the visualization of attention scores to aid in model interpretation. We evaluate the DeepSecure against state-of-the-art benchmarks on two publicly available datasets, namely, ToN-IoT and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. The experimental evaluation proves that our model can efficiently identify threat types. Beyond demonstrating practical utility, the proposed framework can help address the lack of interpretation and justification for complex models in cyber threat detection and will allow organizations to respond to potential security incidents quickly.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words. Compared with the existing approaches, our proposed framework is based on the perspective of human psychology with higher credibility and significant theoretical support. In addition, we purposefully design and implement an intuitive visualisation for the framework, instead of complex numerical representations, to improve the explanation comprehensibility for a broader audience.},

CMC text analysis relies on systems capable of providing suitable navigation and knowledge discovery functionalities. However, existing CMC systems focus on structural features, with little support for features derived from message text. This deficiency is attributable to the informational richness and representational complexities associated with CMC text. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose a design framework for CMC text analysis systems. Grounded in systemic functional linguistic theory, the proposed framework advocates the development of systems capable of representing the rich array of information types inherent in CMC text. It also provides guidelines regarding the choice of features, feature selection, and visualization techniques that CMC text analysis systems should employ. The CyberGate system was developed as an instantiation of the design framework. CyberGate incorporates a rich feature set and complementary feature selection and visualization methods, including the writeprints and ink blots techniques. An application example was used to illustrate the system's ability to discern important patterns in CMC text. Furthermore, results from numerous experiments conducted in comparison with benchmark methods confirmed the viability of CyberGate's features and techniques. The results revealed that the CyberGate system and its underlying design framework can dramatically improve CMC text analysis capabilities over those provided by existing systems.},

The design and appearance of these websites makes it difficult for users to manually identify them as fake. Automated detection systems have emerged as a mechanism for combating fake websites, however most are fairly simplistic in terms of their fraud cues and detection methods employed. Consequently, existing systems are susceptible to the myriad of obfuscation tactics used by fraudsters, resulting in highly ineffective fake website detection performance. In light of these deficiencies, we propose the development of a new class of fake website detection systems that are based on statistical learning theory (SLT). Using a design science approach, a prototype system was developed to demonstrate the potential utility of this class of systems. We conducted a series of experiments, comparing the proposed system against several existing fake website detection systems on a test bed encompassing 900 websites. The results indicate that systems grounded in SLT can more accurately detect various categories of fake websites by utilizing richer sets of fraud cues in combination with problem-specific knowledge. Given the hefty cost exacted by fake websites, the results have important implications for e-commerce and online security.},

	abstract = {Patient experience surveys have become a key source of evidence for supporting decision-making and continuous quality improvement within healthcare services. To harness free-text feedback collected as part of these surveys for additional insights, text analytics methods are increasingly employed when the data collected is not amenable to traditional qualitative analysis due to volume. However, while text analytics techniques offer good predictive capabilities, they have limited explanatory features often required in formal decision-making contexts, such as programme monitoring or evaluation. To overcome these limitations, this study integrates computational text and predictive modelling as part of a Computational Grounded Theory method to determine the effect of quality gaps in care dimensions and their prioritisation from free-text feedback. The feedback was collected as part of a national survey to support decisions on continuous improvement in Maternity Services in Ireland. Our approach enables (1) operationalising the service quality lexicon in the context of maternity care to explain the effect of quality gaps in care dimensions on overall satisfaction from free-text comments; and (2) extending the service quality lexicon with two organisational and political decision-making concepts: “Salience” and “Valence”, for prioritising perceived quality gaps. These methodological affordances enable the extension of service quality theory to explicitly support the prioritisation of improvement decisions which before now required additional decision frameworks. Results show that tangibles-, process-, and reliability-related care issues have the highest importance in our study context. We also find that hospital contexts partly determine the relative importance of gaps in care dimensions.},

DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

Thus, previous studies have applied automatic video categorization methods to enable users to find videos corresponding to their needs; however, emotion has not been a factor considered in these classification methods. Therefore, this study classified YouTube videos into six emotion categories (i.e., happiness, anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and surprise). Through unsupervised and supervised learning methods, this study first categorized videos according to emotion. An ensemble model was subsequently applied to integrate the classification results of both methods. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method effectively facilitates the classification of YouTube videos into suitable emotion categories.},

People express their feelings directly or indirectly through facial expressions, language, writing, or behavior. An emotion detection tool is a critical and practical way to recognize and categorize moods in various applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) is often used to identify emotions. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms produce high-quality solutions for diagnosing emotional diseases among social media users. Numerous studies and survey articles have been published on emotion detection using textual data. However, most of these studies did not comprehensively address the emerging architectures and performance analyses in emotion detection. This study provides an extensive survey of state-of-the-art systems, techniques, and datasets for textual emotion recognition. Another goal of this study is to emphasize the limitations and provide up-and-coming research directions to fill these gaps in this rapidly evolving field. This survey paper investigated the concepts and performance of different categories of textual emotion detection models, approaches, and methodologies.},

Recognizing users’ emotions is an important topic for human–computer interaction. Computers that recognize emotions would provide more natural interactions. Also, emotion detection helps design human-centred systems that provide adaptable behaviour change interventions based on users’ emotions. The growing capability of machine learning to analyze big data and extract emotions therein has led to a surge in research in this domain. With this increased attention, it becomes essential to investigate this research area and provide a comprehensive review of the current state. In this paper, we conduct a systematic review of 123 papers on machine learning-based emotion detection to investigate research trends along many themes, including machine learning approaches, application domain, data, evaluation, and outcome. The results demonstrate: 1) increasing interest in this domain, 2) supervised machine learning (namely, SVM and Naïve Bayes) are the most popular algorithms, 3) Text datasets in the English language are the most common data source, and 4) most research use Accuracy to evaluate performance. Based on the findings, we suggest future directions and recommendations for developing human-centred systems.},

	url = {https://aclanthology.org/C18-1179},
	abstract = {Several datasets have been annotated and published for classification of emotions. They differ in several ways: (1) the use of different annotation schemata (e. g., discrete label sets, including joy, anger, fear, or sadness or continuous values including valence, or arousal), (2) the domain, and, (3) the file formats. This leads to several research gaps: supervised models often only use a limited set of available resources. Additionally, no previous work has compared emotion corpora in a systematic manner. We aim at contributing to this situation with a survey of the datasets, and aggregate them in a common file format with a common annotation schema. Based on this aggregation, we perform the first cross-corpus classification experiments in the spirit of future research enabled by this paper, in order to gain insight and a better understanding of differences of models inferred from the data. This work also simplifies the choice of the most appropriate resources for developing a model for a novel domain. One result from our analysis is that a subset of corpora is better classified with models trained on a different corpus. For none of the corpora, training on all data altogether is better than using a subselection of the resources. Our unified corpus is available at http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/data/unifyemotion.},

Every major event in the world has an online presence and social media. Users use social media platforms to express their sentiments and opinions towards it. In this paper, an advanced framework for detection of emotions of users in Multilanguage text data using emotion theories has been presented, which deals with linguistics and psychology. The emotion extraction system is developed based on multiple features groups for the better understanding of emotion lexicons. Empirical studies of three real-time events in domains like a Political election, healthcare, and sports are performed using proposed framework. The technique used for dynamic keywords collection is based on RSS (Rich Site Summary) feeds of headlines of news articles and trending hashtags from Twitter. An intelligent data collection model has been developed using dynamic keywords. Every word of emotion contained in a tweet is important in decision making and hence to retain the importance of multilingual emotional words, effective pre-processing technique has been used. Naive Bayes algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are used for fine-grained emotions classification of tweets. Experiments conducted on collected data sets, show that the proposed method performs better in comparison to corpus-driven approach which assign affective orientation or scores to words. The proposed emotion extraction framework performs better on the collected dataset by combining feature sets consisting of words from publicly available lexical resources. Furthermore, the presented work for extraction of emotion from tweets performs better in comparisons of other popular sentiment analysis techniques which are dependent of specific existing affect lexicons.},

Existing approaches for multilingual emotion detection from text face challenges with data scarcity across many languages and a lack of interpretability. We propose a novel method that leverages both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained language models to improve performance and interpretability. Our approach involves 1) training a high-performing English monolingual model in parallel with a multilingual model and 2) using knowledge distillation to transfer the emotion detection capabilities from the monolingual teacher to the multilingual student model. Experiments on a multilingual dataset demonstrate significant performance gains for refined multilingual models like XLM-RoBERTa and E5 after distillation. Furthermore, our approach enhances interpretability by enabling better identification of emotion-trigger words. Our work presents a promising direction for building accurate, robust and explainable multilingual emotion detection systems.},

XLM-R performs particularly well on low-resource languages, improving 15.7\% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 11.4\% for Urdu over previous XLM models. We also present a detailed empirical analysis of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks.

Demonstrating that they independently predict mortality and hospitalizations among outpatients with coronary disease could emphasize their clinical value.Methods and Results— This study evaluated the prognostic utility of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), a disease-specific health status measure for patients with coronary artery disease. Patients were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from 6 Veterans Affairs General Internal Medicine Clinics. All patients reporting coronary artery disease who completed a SAQ and had 1 year of follow-up were analyzed (n=5558). SAQ predictor variables were the physical limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, and quality-of-life scores. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality, and a secondary outcome was hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Lower SAQ scores were associated with increased risks of mortality and ACS admissions. Prognostic models controlling for demographic and clinical characteristics demonstrated significant independent mortality risk with lower SAQ physical limitation scores; odds ratios for mild, moderate, and severe limitation were 1.5, 2.0, and 4.0 versus minimal limitation (P{\textless}0.001). Odds ratios for mild, moderate, and severe angina frequency were 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 (P=0.078). The odds ratios for ACS admission among those with mild, moderate, and severe angina frequency were 1.4, 2.0, and 2.2, respectively (P=0.016).Conclusions— SAQ scores are independently associated with 1-year mortality and ACS among outpatients with coronary disease and may serve a valuable role in the risk stratification of such patients.},

          Recent research findings from selected publications focusing on links between social support and physical health are summarized.
          Recent findings 
          Current research is extending our understanding of the influences of social support on health. Many epidemiological studies have concentrated on further linking measures of social support to physical health outcomes. A few studies are now moving into newer areas, such as emphasizing health links with support receipt and provision. Researchers are also interested in outlining relevant pathways, including potential biological (i.e. inflammation) and behavioral (i.e. health behaviors) mechanisms. Interventions attempting to apply basic research on the positive effects of social support are also widespread. Although the longer term effects of such interventions on physical health remain to be determined, such interventions show promise in influencing the quality of life in many chronic disease populations.
          Summary 
          Recent findings often show a robust relationship in which social and emotional support from others can be protective for health. The next generation of studies must explain, however, why this relationship exists and the specificity of such links. This research is in its infancy but will be crucial in order to better tailor support interventions that can impact on physical health outcomes.},

Purpose offers a testable, causal system that synthesizes outcomes including life expectancy, satisfaction, and mental and physical health. These outcomes may be explained best by considering the motivation of the individual—a motivation that comes from having a purpose. We provide a detailed definition with specific hypotheses derived from a synthesis of relevant findings from social, behavioral, biological, and cognitive literatures. To illustrate the uniqueness of the purpose model, we compared purpose with competing contemporary models that offer similar predictions.

	abstract = {Purpose in life predicts both health and longevity suggesting that the ability to find meaning from life’s experiences, especially when confronting life’s challenges, may be a mechanism underlying resilience. Having purpose in life may motivate reframing stressful situations to deal with them more productively, thereby facilitating recovery from stress and trauma. In turn, enhanced ability to recover from negative events may allow a person to achieve or maintain a feeling of greater purpose in life over time. In a large sample of adults (aged 36-84 years) from the MIDUS study (Midlife in the U.S., http://www.midus.wisc.edu/), we tested whether purpose in life was associated with better emotional recovery following exposure to negative picture stimuli indexed by the magnitude of the eyeblink startle reflex (EBR), a measure sensitive to emotional state. We differentiated between initial emotional reactivity (during stimulus presentation) and emotional recovery (occurring after stimulus offset). Greater purpose in life, assessed over two years prior, predicted better recovery from negative stimuli indexed by a smaller eyeblink after negative pictures offset, even after controlling for initial reactivity to the stimuli during the picture presentation, gender, age, trait affect, and other well-being dimensions. These data suggest a proximal mechanism by which purpose in life may afford protection from negative events and confer resilience is through enhanced automatic emotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.},

	abstract = {The links between social capital and mental wellbeing are established but the direction of the social capital-wellbeing relationship is rarely systematically examined. This omission undermines the validity of social capital as a basis for health interventions. The aim of this paper was to explore the short-term (one-year) reciprocal relationship between community participation – an important component of social capital – and mental wellbeing. We used nationally representative Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey data, 2005–11. The HILDA Survey is an annual cohort study from which was extracted a sub-sample of panel data (the same people participating across multiple waves) enabling us to use fixed effects regression methods to model the longitudinal association of mental health and participation controlling for individual heterogeneity. The results showed that better mental wellbeing in one year was generally related to more community participation the next year, while greater past community participation was linked to better mental wellbeing the next year independent of (i) initial mental wellbeing, (ii) multiple potentially confounding factors and (iii) unobserved and time-constant heterogeneity. Political participation was marginally related to worse mental health in both directions. The results also showed that the association between community participation and mental wellbeing the next year is weaker for those with poor initial wellbeing than for initially healthier respondents. Our findings may inform the trial and scientific evaluation of programs aimed at increasing informal social connectedness and civic engagement to promote mental wellbeing.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on how educating people through social media platforms can help reduce the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 to manage the global health crisis. The pandemic has posed a global mental health crisis, and correct information is indispensable to dispel uncertainty, fear, and mental stress to unify global communities in collective combat against COVID-19 disease worldwide. Mounting studies specified that manifestly endless coronavirus-related newsfeeds and death numbers considerably increased the risk of global mental health issues. Social media provided positive and negative data, and the COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide infodemic. It has eroded public trust and impeded virus restraint, which outlived the coronavirus pandemic itself. The study incorporated the narrative review analysis based on the existing literature related to mental health problems using the non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) approach to minimize the COVID-19 adverse consequences on global mental health. The study performed a search of the electronic databases available at PsycINFO, PubMed, and LISTA. This research incorporates the statistical data related to the COVID-19 provided by the WHO, John Hopkins University, and Pakistani Ministry of Health. Pakistan reported the second-highest COVID-19 cases within South Asia, the fifth-highest number of cases in Asia after Iran, India, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the 14th highest recorded cases, as of October 14, 2020. Pakistan effectively managed the COVID-19 pandemic in the second wave. It stands at the eighth-highest number of confirmed cases in Asia, the 3rd-highest in South Asia, and the 28th-highest number of established patients globally, as of February20, 2021. The COVID-19 has resulted in over 108.16 million confirmed cases, deaths over 2.374 million, and a recovery of 80.16 million people worldwide, as of February 12, 2021. This study focused on exploring the COVID-19 pandemic’s adverse effects on global public health and the indispensable role of social media to provide the correct information in the COVID-19 health crisis. The findings’ generalizability offers helpful insight for crisis management and contributes to the scientific literature. The results might provide a stepping-stone for conduct future empirical studies by including other factors to conclude exciting developments.},

To (1) provide a framework for the conceptualization of emotional vitality as an important construct for rehabilitation professionals; (2) outline the existing scope and breadth of knowledge currently available regarding the definition and measurement of emotional vitality in persons with chronic health conditions; and (3) identify the extent to which the components can be mapped to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).
Design
Activities included a scoping review of the literature, and a Delphi mapping exercise using the ICF.

Intervention
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measure
Not applicable.
Results
The results of this study suggest that emotional vitality is a complex latent construct that includes (1) physical energy and well-being, (2) regulation of mood, (3) mastery, and (4) engagement and interest in life. Existing literature supported the presence of all 4 components of the construct. The mapping exercise showed that 3 of these components could be readily mapped to the Body Function chapter of the ICF (energy, mood, mastery).
Conclusions
Emotional vitality may influence both the physical and emotional adaptation to living with a chronic illness or disability and should be included in both assessment and treatment planning to optimize rehabilitation outcomes. Future research is needed to refine the definition and identify optimal methods of measuring this construct.},

In this paper, we propose an end-to-end public wellbeing analytics framework designed to predict the public’s wellbeing status and infer insights through the continuous analysis of social media content over several temporal events and across several locations. The proposed framework implements a novel distant supervision approach designed specifically to generate wellbeing-labeled datasets. In addition, it implements a wellbeing prediction model trained on contextualized sentence embeddings using BERT. Wellbeing predictions are visualized using several spatiotemporal analytics that can support decision-makers in gauging the impact of several government decisions and temporal events on the public, aiding in improving the decision-making process. Empirical experiments evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed distant supervision approach, the prediction model, and the utility of the produced analytics in gauging the public wellbeing status in a specific context.},

	abstract = {Social Networking Sites (SNS) have close to 3 billion users worldwide. Recently, however, SNS have come under media scrutiny for their potential association with depression. Two previous meta-analyses failed to find evidence for a robust concurrent association between SNS use and depression symptoms. However, these analyses focused primarily on the time spent using SNS. The current meta-analysis is the first to consider the multi-dimensional nature of SNS use, and examines separately the quantitative associations of depression symptoms to SNS use in three types of SNS studies examining three distinct constructs of SNS use: time spent using SNS, intensity of SNS use, and problematic SNS use. Sixty-two studies (N = 451, 229) met inclusion criteria. Depression symptoms were significantly, but weakly, associated with time spent using SNS (r = 0.11) and intensity of SNS use (r = 0.09). However, the association of depression symptoms to problematic SNS use was moderate (r = 0.29), was significantly higher than for time spent using SNS (Qbetween = 35.85, p {\textless} 0.001) or intensity of SNS use (Qbetween = 13.95, p {\textless} 0.001), and was not significantly moderated by age, gender, year of study publication, or mode of recruitment. These results suggest that future research examining causal models of the relation of SNS use and depression, as well as research on intervention and prevention, should focus in more detail on individuals who are engaging in a pattern of problematic SNS use.},

Earlier studies on tracking students’ happiness in academia showed that many of them struggle with mental health issues. For example, a 2015 study at the University of California Berkeley found that 47 \% of graduate students suffer from depression, following a 2005 study that showed 10 \% had considered suicide. This is the first large-scale study that uses signals from social media to evaluate students’ emotional wellbeing in academia. This work presents fine-grained emotion and opinion analysis of 79,329 tweets produced by students from 44 universities. The goal of this study is to qualitatively evaluate and compare emotions and sentiments emanating from students’ communications across different academic discourse types and across universities in the U.S. We first build novel predictive models to categorize academic discourse types generated by students into personal, social, and general categories. We then apply emotion and sentiment classification models to annotate each tweet with six Ekman’s emotions – joy, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, and surprise and three opinion types – positive, negative, and neutral. We found that emotions and opinions expressed by students vary across discourse types and universities, and correlate with survey-based data on student satisfaction, happiness and stress. Moreover, our results provide novel insights on how students use social media to share academic information, emotions, and opinions that would pertain to students academic performance and emotional well-being.},

	abstract = {Using Apple’s Screen Time application to obtain reported actual iPhone and social media (SM) use, we examined the accuracy of retrospective estimates of usage, how inaccuracies bias associations between use and psychosocial well-being (depression, loneliness, and life satisfaction), and the degree to which inaccuracies were predicted by levels of well-being. Among a sample of 325 iPhone users, we found that (a) participants misestimated their weekly overall iPhone and SM use by 19.1 and 12.2 hours, respectively; (b) correlations between estimated use and well-being variables were consistently stronger than the correlations between reported actual use and well-being variables; and (c) the degree of inaccuracy in estimated use was associated with levels of participant well-being and amount of use. These findings suggest that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be systematically biased by factors that are fundamental to the associations under investigation. We propose that retrospective estimates of digital technology use may be capturing the construct of perceived use rather than actual use, and discuss how the antecedents, correlates, and consequences of perceived use may be distinct from those of actual use. Implications of these findings are discussed in view of the ongoing debate surrounding the effects of digital technology use on well-being.},

We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive and recent exploration into the relationship between Social Media Platforms (SMP) usage and Social Media Disorders (SMD) is currently investigated as a topic of increasing importance given the surge in SMP use over the last two decades. The approach of analyzing data from 479 individuals across various SMP using clustering is particularly noteworthy for identifying the risk profile of the users and understanding the diverse impacts of SMP on mental health. In this paper, a multiple-option descriptive-predictive framework for assessing the impact of the SMP on the psychological well-being is proposed. This method effectively categorizes mental health states into distinct groups, each indicating different levels of need for professional intervention. Out of 5 clustering algorithms, K-prototypes proved to bring the best results with a silhouette score of 0.596, whereas for predicting clusters, Random Forest (RF) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperformed K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), providing the highest accuracy and F1 score (0.993). Moreover, we analyze the connectedness between each SMP, anxiety and depression. Two distinct clusters emerged: Cluster 0 “Stable Professionals”, Cluster 1 “Vibrant Students”, and new instances are seamlessly predicted. While Youtube is the most popular platform among the respondents, Instagram shows a relatively higher correlation with both anxiety (0.256) and depression (0.186), indicating a stronger association with these disorders compared to other platforms.},

Even without the use of prompt engineering, it is shown that GPT's predictions align significantly with human-provided appraisals and emotional labels. However, GPT faces difficulties predicting emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 showed the highest performance in the initial study but fell short in the second, despite providing superior results after minor prompt engineering. This assessment brings up questions on how to effectively employ the strong points and address the weak areas of these models, particularly concerning response variability.

	abstract = {ChatGPT has sparked extensive discussions within the healthcare community since its November 2022 release. However, potential applications in the field of psychiatry have received limited attention. Deep learning has proven beneficial to psychiatry, and GPT is a powerful deep learning‐based language model with immense potential for this field. Despite the convenience of ChatGPT, this advanced chatbot currently has limited practical applications in psychiatry. It may be used to support psychiatrists in routine tasks such as completing medical records, facilitating communications between clinicians and with patients, polishing academic writings and presentations, and programming and performing analyses for research. The current training and application of ChatGPT require using appropriate prompts to maximize appropriate outputs and minimize deleterious inaccuracies and phantom errors. Moreover, future GPT advances that incorporate empathy, emotion recognition, personality assessment, and detection of mental health warning signs are essential for its effective integration into psychiatric care. In the near future, developing a fully‐automated psychotherapy system trained for expert communication (such as psychotherapy verbatim) is conceivable by building on foundational GPT technology. This dream system should integrate practical ‘real world’ inputs and friendly AI user and patient interfaces
              via
              clinically validated algorithms, voice comprehension/generation modules, and emotion discrimination algorithms based on facial expressions and physiological inputs from wearable devices. In addition to the technology challenges, we believe it is critical to establish generally accepted ethical standards for applying ChatGPT‐related tools in all mental healthcare environments, including telemedicine and academic/training settings.},

Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.},

	abstract = {Whereas modern medicine has enabled humans to live longer and more robust lives, recent years have seen a significant increase in chronic care costs. The prevention of threats to mobility, such as falls, freezing of gait, and others, is critical for chronic disease management. Researchers and physicians often analyze data from wearable motion sensor–based information systems (IS) to prevent falls because of their convenience, low cost, and user privacy protection. However, prior studies on fall prevention often achieve suboptimal performance because of their limited capacities in modeling data distributions. In this study, we adopt the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel fall prevention framework, which includes the hidden Markov model with generative adversarial network (HMM-GAN) that extracts temporal and sequential patterns from sensor signals and recognizes snippet states, and a logistic regression that utilizes the snippet states and determines whether and when to trigger protective devices to prevent fall injuries. Drawing upon the HMM, deep learning, and a new expectation-maximization instantiation, the proposed framework addresses limitations of existing methods by automatically extracting features from motion sensor data, accounting for both independent and sequential information in data snippets, operating on sensor signals with varying distributions and sharp peaks and valleys, allowing lead times, and being applicable in both semisupervised and supervised modes. We evaluate the proposed fall prevention framework against prevailing fall prevention models and the HMM-GAN component against state-of-the-art sensor analytics models on selected large-scale ground truth data sets containing thousands of falls and normal activities. Through an in-depth case study, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can lead to significantly reduced potentially catastrophic falls by senior citizens and produce more than \$33 million of economic benefits over competing models. Besides practical health information technology contributions, HMM-GAN offers methodological contributions to the IS knowledge base for scholars designing novel information technology artifacts for healthcare applications.

	abstract = {Clinical intelligence about a patient’s risk of future adverse health events can support clinical decision making in personalized and preventive care. Healthcare predictive analytics using electronic health records offers a promising direction to address the challenging tasks of risk profiling. Patients with chronic diseases often face risks of not just one, but an array of adverse health events. However, existing risk models typically focus on one specific event and do not predict multiple outcomes. To attain enhanced risk profiling, we adopt the design science paradigm and propose a principled approach called Bayesian multitask learning (BMTL). Considering the model development for an event as a single task, our BMTL approach is to coordinate a set of baseline models—one for each event—and communicate training information across the models. The BMTL approach allows healthcare providers to achieve multifaceted risk profiling and model an arbitrary number of events simultaneously. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that the BMTL approach attains an improved predictive performance when compared with the alternatives that model multiple events separately. We also find that, in most cases, the BMTL approach significantly outperforms existing multitask learning techniques. More importantly, our analysis shows that the BMTL approach can create significant potential impacts on clinical practice in reducing the failures and delays in preventive interventions. We discuss several implications of this study for health IT, big data and predictive analytics, and design science research.},

Here we present experiments designed to investigate public perceptions and policy preferences about social bots, in particular how they are affected by exposure to bots. We find that before exposure, participants have some biases: they tend to overestimate the prevalence of bots and see others as more vulnerable to bot influence than themselves. These biases are amplified after bot exposure. Furthermore, exposure tends to impair judgment of bot-recognition self-efficacy and increase propensity toward stricter bot-regulation policies among participants. Decreased self-efficacy and increased perceptions of bot influence on others are significantly associated with these policy preference changes. We discuss the relationship between perceptions about social bots and growing dissatisfaction with the polluted social media environment.},

Social networks are playing an increasingly important role as early warning systems, aiding with rapid disaster assessment and post-disaster recovery. There is a need for both the public and disaster-relief agencies to better understand how social media can be utilized to assess and respond to natural disasters. However, existing research on the role of social media in society's response to natural disasters is neither holistic nor systematic. In this study, we conduct a hierarchical multiscale analysis based on multiple data resources, combining social media data, economic losses, and geo-information. We verify the role played by social media before, during, and after a natural disaster. We investigate whether the combination of social media and geo-location information can contribute to a more efficient early warning system and help with disaster assessment. This paper draws attention to the fact that during a disaster, citizens turn to social media and the majority of tweets contain information about the hurricane and/or its impact with negative sentiment. We demonstrate that the severity of damage in one area is positively correlated with the intensity of disaster-related activity. Meanwhile, the coastal areas and areas with close proximity to Hurricane center tend to suffer from higher losses during a disaster. Our findings explore the role played by social media from individuals in affected populations and how they respond to unfolding natural disasters. Results hold significance with regard to providing timely assistance for both official institutions and netizens.},

To the best of our knowledge, no study has been conducted to determine the sensitivity of social media to different types or magnitudes of natural disasters under various circumstances. We select four types of natural disasters (tornadoes, winter storms, wildfires, and floods) and for each we examine multiple recent events along with the associated Twitter behavior to evaluate multiple aspects: duration of social media attention, frequency shifts, frequency shifts for different social vulnerability levels, tweet proximity to the disasters, and sentiment. The results demonstrate that Twitter is indeed a social sensor with different sensitivity levels to natural disasters and depending on the event circumstances, a diverse pattern of social media behavior should be expected.},

	abstract = {With the advent of climate change and the 5 G era, online communities are increasingly becoming the main medium for information dissemination after emergencies such as natural disasters. The widespread dissemination of negative online information may generate cyber violence or lead to serious adverse psychological outcomes. This study considered a natural disaster event involving avoidable deaths and child casualties as an example to identify emotional contagion and conduct simulation interventions. Data about the aftermath of the 8·13 flash flood in the Longcaogou Scenic Area, Sichuan Province, China, were derived from the Chinese Sina microblog. We analyzed key parameters and modeled them in a dynamic model. We further evaluated the effects of implementing intervention measures (such as transmission path interruption and changing the number of different emotions) on emotional spread. The overall sentiment of posters after this flood was negative, with three epidemic peaks. Negative emotions were more persistent and contagious than positive emotions. Reducing the number of negative blog posts by half could have led to a 14.97\% reduction in negative comments and a 7.17\% reduction in positive comments. Simultaneously, reducing the number of negative blog posts and increasing the number of positive posts would have helped reduce the relative ratio of negative to positive comments. The findings have theoretical and practical implications for developing an emotional contagion model and formulating intervention strategies to guide public opinion after an emergency that involves extensive online debate.},

In the process, a myriad of emotions are experienced, with many of them being negative in nature. Research suggests that during moderately challenging situations individuals experiencing negative emotions may engage in coping attempts to improve their emotional state. Consumption has been one strategy used by individuals to mitigate negative emotions. This research extends previous research by exploring whether such emotion regulation processes occur in extreme conditions such as natural disasters. Specifically, it examines the emotions experienced by individuals, the antecedents of these emotions, as well as how individuals regulate their emotions through consumption. A conceptual model is proposed and tested in Study 1 and findings are once again corroborated in a follow-up study. Implications for mitigating negative emotions and improving subjective well-being during extreme crisis situations are discussed.},

Believing that an event is controllable does not always lead to a reduction in stress or to a positive outcome, and believing that an event is uncontrollable does not always lead to an increase in stress or to a negative outcome. The present author shows how 2 forms of control, generalized beliefs about control and situational appraisals of control, fit into the overall model of Lazarus and colleagues. Situational appraisals of control are explored, especially as they relate to health matters. The theoretical formulation of stress and coping is drawn on to examine 3 important issues: (a) how believing one has control in a stressful transaction can heighten threat, (b) the relationship between control and coping, and (c) pathways through which control can affect the adaptational outcomes of stressful encounters.

	abstract = {Background Disasters have substantial consequences for population mental health. Social media data present an opportunity for mental health surveillance after disasters to help identify areas of mental health needs. We aimed to 1) identify specific basic emotions from Twitter for the greater New York City area during Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall on October 29, 2012, and to 2) detect and map spatial temporal clusters representing excess risk of these emotions. Methods We applied an advanced sentiment analysis on 344,957 Twitter tweets in the study area over eleven days, from October 22 to November 1, 2012, to extract basic emotions, a space-time scan statistic (SaTScan) and a geographic information system (QGIS) to detect and map excess risk of these emotions. Results Sadness and disgust were among the most prominent emotions identified. Furthermore, we noted 24 spatial clusters of excess risk of basic emotions over time: Four for anger, one for confusion, three for disgust, five for fear, five for sadness, and six for surprise. Of these, anger, confusion, disgust and fear clusters appeared pre disaster, a cluster of surprise was found peri disaster, and a cluster of sadness emerged post disaster. Conclusions We proposed a novel syndromic surveillance approach for mental health based on social media data that may support conventional approaches by providing useful additional information in the context of disaster. We showed that excess risk of multiple basic emotions could be mapped in space and time as a step towards anticipating acute stress in the population and identifying community mental health need rapidly and efficiently in the aftermath of disaster. More studies are needed to better control for bias, identify associations with reliable and valid instruments measuring mental health, and to explore computational methods for continued model-fitting, causal relationships, and ongoing evaluation. Our study may be a starting point also for more fully elaborated models that can either prospectively detect mental health risk using real-time social media data or detect excess risk of emotional reactions in areas that lack efficient infrastructure during and after disasters. As such, social media data may be used for mental health surveillance after large scale disasters to help identify areas of mental health needs and to guide us in our knowledge where we may most effectively intervene to reduce the mental health consequences of disasters.},

	abstract = {Although flood risk perceptions and their concomitant motivations for behaviour have long been recognised as significant features of community resilience in the face of flooding events, there has, for some time now, been a poorly appreciated fissure in the accompanying literature. Specifically, rationalist and constructivist paradigms in the broader domain of risk perception provide different (though not always conflicting) contexts for interpreting evidence and developing theory. This contribution reviews the major constructs that have been applied to understanding flood risk perceptions and contextualises these within broader conceptual developments around risk perception theory and contemporary thinking around flood risk management. We argue that there is a need to re-examine and re-invigorate flood risk perception research, in a manner that is comprehensively underpinned by more constructivist thinking around flood risk management as well as by developments in broader risk perception research. We draw attention to an historical over-emphasis on the cognitive perceptions of those at risk to the detriment of a richer understanding of a wider range of flood risk perceptions such as those of policy-makers or of tax-payers who live outside flood affected areas as well as the linkages between these perspectives and protective measures such as state-supported flood insurance schemes. Conclusions challenge existing understandings of the relationship between risk perception and flood management, particularly where the latter relates to communication strategies and the extent to which those at risk from flooding feel responsible for taking protective actions.},

To support decision-makers with timely information, we utilize data from online social networks to propose an adaptable information extraction solution to create indices helping to forecast COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalization rates. We show that combining heterogeneous data sources like Twitter and Reddit can leverage these sources' inherent complementarity and yield better predictions than those using a single data source alone. We further show that the predictions run ahead of the official COVID-19 incidences by up to 14 days.

These effects may be distributed unequally, affecting some communities more profoundly and possibly over longer time periods than others. Here, we analyze the effects of four major US hurricanes, namely, Irma, Harvey, Florence, and Dorian on the emotional well-being of the affected communities and regions. We show that a community’s emotional response to a hurricane event can be measured from the content of social media that its population posted before, during, and after the hurricane. For each hurricane making landfall in the US, we observe a significant decrease in sentiment in the affected areas before and during the hurricane followed by a rapid return to pre-hurricane baseline, often within 1-2 weeks. However, some communities exhibit markedly different rates of decline and return to previous equilibrium levels. This points towards the possibility of measuring the emotional resilience of communities from the dynamics of their online emotional response.},

	abstract = {YouTube is the second-most visited webpage in the world and boasts over 2 billion users and 500 h of videos uploaded every hour. Despite this popularity, relatively few articles have discussed the practical use of searching and YouTube as a research tool and source of data. The purpose of our paper is to propose a step-by-step schematic for utilizing the YouTube platform. Our discussions include (a) when/whether to use YouTube for research; (b) selecting an appropriate research design; (c) how to search for YouTube data; (d) what data can be pulled from YouTube; and (e) the contextual limitations for interpreting YouTube data. Further, we provide practical strategies and considerations when searching, collecting, or interpreting YouTube data. These discussions are informed by our own work using the YouTube platform. Effective methods used to search for YouTube data are likely to extend beyond simply searching the platform itself; the search strategy and search results themselves should also be documented. While not exhaustive, we feel these considerations and strategies present themselves as a conceptual foothold for future research using the YouTube platform.},

	abstract = {Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require “reading the tea leaves” to interpret; additionally, they offer users minimal control over the formatting and specificity of resulting topics. To tackle these issues, we introduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to uncover latent topics in a text collection. TopicGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing methods: it achieves a harmonic mean purity of 0.74 against human-annotated Wikipedia topics compared to 0.64 for the strongest baseline. Its topics are also more interpretable, dispensing with ambiguous bags of words in favor of topics with natural language labels and associated free-form descriptions. Moreover, the framework is highly adaptable, allowing users to specify constraints and modify topics without the need for model retraining. By streamlining access to high-quality and interpretable topics, TopicGPT represents a compelling, human-centered approach to topic modeling.},

	abstract = {Emotion mining has become a crucial tool for understanding human emotions during disasters, leveraging the extensive data generated on social media platforms. This paper aims to summarize existing research on emotion mining within disaster contexts, highlighting both significant discoveries and persistent issues. On the one hand, emotion mining techniques have achieved acceptable accuracy enabling applications such as rapid damage assessment and mental health surveillance. On the other hand, with many studies adopting data-driven approaches, several methodological issues remain. These include arbitrary emotion classification, ignoring biases inherent in data collection from social media, such as the overrepresentation of individuals from higher socioeconomic status on Twitter, and the lack of application of theoretical frameworks like cross-cultural comparisons. These problems can be summarized as a notable lack of theory-driven research and ignoring insights from social and behavioral sciences. This paper underscores the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and social scientists to develop more robust and theoretically grounded approaches in emotion mining. By addressing these gaps, we aim to enhance the effectiveness and reliability of emotion mining methodologies, ultimately contributing to improved disaster preparedness, response, and recovery.},

	abstract = {Understanding media frames and the public resonance during disasters is essential for making inclusive climate change and adaptation policies in the context of increasingly extreme weather events. In this study, we use the extreme weather and flood event that occurred in July 2021 in Zhengzhou, China, as a case study to investigate how official media in China reported this event and how the public responded. Moreover, since one accountability investigation report regarding this disaster was released in January 2022, we also compared these posts between the emergency response period and the post-crisis learning period after the report’s release. Topic modeling using the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) method and emotion analysis were conducted to analyze the posts from Weibo, China’s primary social media platform. The results demonstrated that the posts from official media and the public comments differed in both topics and emotions, with relatively little coherence. During the emergency response period, the media’s posts focused more on the facts, such as the extreme weather event, the places where it occurred, the impacts, and the search and rescue efforts, while the public comments were more about help appeals from the neglected ones in the rural areas, and emotional expressions such as moral support, condolence or encouragement to the victims and their families. After the accountability investigation in January, the media’s posts primarily covered the investigation process, the punishment, the attribution of disaster consequences, and the lessons learned, while the public’s comments were relatively emotional, praised the good, condoled the victims, and condemned the villains. The dominant emotion from the media’s posts was “like” in July 2021, but it became depression in January 2022. Anger was the prevalent emotion from the public during all the stages. This study provided valuable knowledge to the current understanding of the different patterns and dynamics of official media reports and the public’s resonance in disaster management.},

They threaten harm or death to a large group of people; cause disruption of services and social networks and a communal loss of resources; and involve identifiable mental and physical health outcomes, among those affected. While majority of individuals who experience a traumatic event due to natural disasters do not develop psychopathology, natural disasters can threaten our psychological well-being in many ways and they can result in both short and long-term psychological distress and thus create a significant burden of mental health conditions on individuals and the community affected by them. In this paper we provide a narrative review that focuses on the mental health effects of natural disasters. We discuss effective, evidence-based interventions that can help enhance the sense of safety, hope, and optimism, as well as serve to promote social connectedness for those who are impacted. We describe how these interventions, developed by keeping in mind the cultural context and the needs of the community, can be provided pre, peri and post-disaster period to improve the adverse mental health effects of the disaster.},

            Cities are the engines for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which provide a blueprint for achieving global sustainability. However, knowledge gaps exist in quantitatively assessing progress towards SDGs for different-sized cities. There is a shortage of relevant statistical data for many cities, especially small cities, in developing/underdeveloped countries. Here we devise and test a systematic method for assessing SDG progress using open-source big data for 254 Chinese cities and compare the results with those obtained using statistical data. We find that big data is a promising alternative for tracking the overall SDG progress of cities, including those lacking relevant statistical data (83 Chinese cities). Our analysis reveals decreasing SDG Index scores (representing the overall SDG performance) with the decrease in the size of Chinese cities, suggesting the need to improve SDG progress in small and medium cities to achieve more balanced sustainability at the (sub)national level.},

The project is based on the content analysis of 1093 DSS articles published in 14 major journals from 1990 to 2004. An examination of the findings of each part of the project yields eight key issues that the DSS field should address for it to continue to play an important part in information systems scholarship. These eight issues are: the relevance of DSS research, DSS research methods and paradigms, the judgement and decision-making theoretical foundations of DSS research, the role of the IT artifact in DSS research, the funding of DSS research, inertia and conservatism of DSS research agendas, DSS exposure in general “A” journals, and discipline coherence. The discussion of each issue is based on the data derived from the article content analysis. A number of suggestions are made for the improvement of DSS research. These relate to case study research, design science, professional relevance, industry funding, theoretical foundations, data warehousing, and business intelligence. The suggestions should help DSS researchers construct high quality research agendas that are relevant and rigorous.},

A total of 984,311 geo-referenced tweets with negative basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, shame) were collected and assigned to the census tracts within NYC boroughs between 8 October and 18 November 2012. Global and local univariate and bivariate Moran’s I statistics were used to analyze the data. We found local spatial clusters of all negative emotions over all disaster periods. Socioeconomic status and infrastructural damage were predominantly correlated with disgust, fear, and shame post-disaster. We identified spatial clusters of emotional reactions during and in the aftermath of a large-scale disaster that could help provide guidance about where immediate and long-term relief measures are needed the most, if transferred to similar events and on comparable data worldwide.},

Findings show that both negative and positive emotional responses spike at the start of the event, with positive emotions remaining high in the weeks following the event. Uses of language related to social connections, as well as references to home and work, increased during and after the event. Tweets used pronouns focused on the self during the event but shifted to pronouns focused on the collective after the event.

	abstract = {The rise of emotional intelligence technology and the recent debate about the possibility of a “sentient” artificial intelligence (AI) urge the need to study the role of emotion during people’s interactions with AIs. In customer service, human employees are increasingly replaced by AI agents, such as chatbots, and often these AI agents are equipped with emotion-expressing capabilities to replicate the positive impact of human-expressed positive emotion. But is it indeed beneficial? This research explores how, when, and why an AI agent’s expression of positive emotion affects customers’ service evaluations. Through controlled experiments in which the subjects interacted with a service agent (AI or human) to resolve a hypothetical service issue, we provide answers to these questions. We show that AI-expressed positive emotion can influence customers affectively (by evoking customers’ positive emotions) and cognitively (by violating customers’ expectations) in opposite directions. Thus, positive emotion expressed by an AI agent (versus a human employee) is less effective in facilitating service evaluations. We further underscore that, depending on customers’ expectations toward their relationship with a service agent, AI-expressed positive emotion may enhance or hurt service evaluations. Overall, our work provides useful guidance on how and when companies can best deploy emotion-expressing AI agents.
          , 
            Customer service employees are generally advised to express positive emotion during their interactions with customers. The rise and maturity of artificial intelligence (AI)–powered conversational agents, also known as chatbots, beg the question: should AI agents be equipped with the ability to express positive emotion during customer service interactions? This research explores how, when, and why an AI agent’s expression of positive emotion affects customers’ service evaluations. We argue that AI-expressed positive emotion can influence customers via dual pathways: an affective pathway of emotional contagion and a cognitive pathway of expectation–disconfirmation. We propose that positive emotion expressed by an AI agent (versus a human employee) is less effective in facilitating service evaluations because of a heightened level of expectation–disconfirmation. We further introduce a novel individual difference variable, customers’ relationship norm orientation, which affects their expectations toward the AI agent and moderates the cognitive pathway. Results from three laboratory experiments substantiate our claims. By revealing a distinctive impact of positive emotion expressed by an AI agent compared with a human employee, these findings deepen our understanding of customers’ reactions to emotional AIs, and they offer valuable insights for the deployment of AIs in customer service.

	abstract = {Natural disasters are large-scale catastrophic events, and they are increasing in frequency and severity. Converging evidence indicates that the mental health consequences of disasters are extensive and are often associated with trauma and the disruption of personal and socioeconomic factors in people’s lives. Although most individuals experiencing disaster-related traumatic events do not develop mental illnesses, some experience adverse psychological effects of disasters. These mental health effects begin immediately following a disaster and may persist for extended periods. In this article, we summarize the literature findings to provide a narrative review that focuses on the mental health consequences of natural disasters. An overview of the disaster mental health research field is provided, and the findings are ordered into theoretical frameworks. Then, the development and course of psychopathology regarding disaster aftermath are described in a methodological context. Next, understanding a disaster as an event of transition is highlighted, and the impact of this disaster-specific transition is discussed. Lastly, a potential relationship between the transitional impact of a disaster and mental health consequences is speculated on, and the implications are discussed. The impact of disasters on mental health can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term, and to some extent depends on the recovery process of the affected community. Also, we propose the possible merits of using the Transitional Impact Scale in the context of disaster mental health research by assessing the features of disaster-related transition and its effects on mental health. We conclude by suggesting a direction for future research in terms of measuring the disaster mental health effects in community settings (affected vs. non-affected) and also considering cross-cultural and cross-regional differences. In recent decades, a large amount of knowledge has been gathered from disaster mental health research, but, still, more research is needed to resolve some irregular findings through refining the methodological variations.},

	abstract = {This experiment revealed that emotional news frames (anger-inducing vs. sadness-inducing) affect people’s emotional response to a corporate crisis such as a cell phone battery explosion accident. The distinct emotions induced by different news frames influenced individuals’ information processing (i.e., heuristic vs. systematic processing) and the evaluation of the company differently. Participants exposed to anger-inducing crisis news read the news less closely and had more negative attitudes toward the company than those exposed to sadness-inducing news. Also, emotional frames affected how individuals perceived the different types of corporate responses (relief-focused message vs. punishment-focused message; emotional appeal vs. no emotional appeal). The advantage of emotional appeals was found contingent on how the crisis was previously framed by the media. Findings demonstrate a potential for developing effective corporate response strategies in a given crisis situation, considering the type of crisis, how it has been framed by the media, the publics’ emotional responses, and the use of emotional appeals.},

	abstract = {This article explores the relationship between threat and information processing in various conflict situations and extends the analysis to an examination of the relationship between affective and cognitive components of decision making about policy under conditions of high and low threat. Elements of threatening situations are measured using public opinion surveys done mainly in Israel regarding the Arab/Israeli conflict and the conflict between religious and secular Jews. Some data from surveys done in the Palestinian Authority regarding support for the peace process and support for armed attacks against Israeli targets, and in the United States regarding the social crises of neighborhood crime out of control and the threat of loss of Social Security and Medicare benefits are included as two other illustrations of the relationship between threat and policy. The article focuses on how feelings of threat relate to decisions about how to deal with the situation and under what conditions those decisions will either be inflammatory or conciliatory. Data are presented demonstrating that feelings of threat correlate with policy choices regarding the threatening situation or group, and often at very strong levels. Specifically, the more threatened people feel, the more their policy choice tends to maintain or intensify the conflict—that is, the more incendiary the policy choice is—and vice versa—the lower the threat the more subdued the policy choice is. Our data analysis leads us to the proposition that when people feel very threatened—the decision making process about policy is dominated by emotion—not by logic or rational considerations. On the other hand, under conditions of low threat, both emotions and logic have a role in the process of deciding policy.},

	abstract = {We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

	abstract = {Modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems are powered by foundation models. This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage. Our largest model is a dense Transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128K tokens. This paper presents an extensive empirical evaluation of Llama 3. We find that Llama 3 delivers comparable quality to leading language models such as GPT-4 on a plethora of tasks. We publicly release Llama 3, including pre-trained and post-trained versions of the 405B parameter language model and our Llama Guard 3 model for input and output safety. The paper also presents the results of experiments in which we integrate image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 via a compositional approach. We observe this approach performs competitively with the state-of-the-art on image, video, and speech recognition tasks. The resulting models are not yet being broadly released as they are still under development.},

            Expert systems are being extensively used to make critical decisions involving emotional analysis in affective computing. The evolution of deep learning algorithms has improved the potential for extracting value from multimodal emotional data. However, these black‐box algorithms do not often explain the heuristics behind processing the input features for achieving certain outputs. This study focuses on the risks of using black‐box deep learning models for critical tasks, such as emotion recognition, and describes how human understandable interpretations of the workings of these models are extremely important. This study utilizes one of the largest multimodal datasets available–CMU‐MOSEI. Many researchers have used the pre‐extracted features provided by the CMU Multimodal SDK with black‐box deep learning models making it difficult to interpret the contribution of its individual features. This study describes the implications of significant features from various modalities (audio, video, text) identified using XAI in Multimodal Emotion Recognition. It describes the process of curating reduced feature models by using the Gradient SHAP XAI method. These reduced models with highly contributing features achieve comparable and at times even better results compared to their corresponding all‐feature models as well as the baseline model GraphMFN. This study reveals that carefully selecting significant features for a model can help filter out irrelevant features, and attenuate the noise or bias caused by them, leading to an improved performance efficiency of the expert systems by making them transparent, easily interpretable, and trustworthy.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters cause significant damage, casualties and economical losses. Twitter has been used to support prompt disaster response and management because people tend to communicate and spread information on public social media platforms during disaster events. To retrieve real-time situational awareness (SA) information from tweets, the most effective way to mine text is using natural language processing (NLP). Among the advanced NLP models, the supervised approach can classify tweets into different categories to gain insight and leverage useful SA information from social media data. However, high-performing supervised models require domain knowledge to specify categories and involve costly labelling tasks. This research proposes a guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) workflow to investigate temporal latent topics from tweets during a recent disaster event, the 2020 Hurricane Laura. With integration of prior knowledge, a coherence model, LDA topics visualisation and validation from official reports, our guided approach reveals that most tweets contain several latent topics during the 10-day period of Hurricane Laura. This result indicates that state-of-the-art supervised models have not fully utilised tweet information because they only assign each tweet a single label. In contrast, our model can not only identify emerging topics during different disaster events but also provides multilabel references to the classification schema. In addition, our results can help to quickly identify and extract SA information to responders, stakeholders and the general public so that they can adopt timely responsive strategies and wisely allocate resource during Hurricane events.},

	abstract = {Digital innovation enables new forms of cyber-physical innovation based on digital business ecosystems. However, the realization of the opportunities arising from such innovation substantially hinges on interoperability, that is, the ability of two or more systems to exchange information and understand that exchanged information. While interoperability is a long-standing topic in research and practice alike and a valuable knowledge base exists, digital innovation poses novel challenges that might not be covered by conventional wisdom. Accordingly, we review the literature and, first, propose an organizing framework for existing interoperability knowledge involving the contextual conditions of low interoperability, the mechanisms to increase interoperability, and the associated outcomes. Second, we use the framework to identify previous research foci in the scholarly discourse about interoperability and to discuss the potential limitations of this past work in light of digital innovation. Third, we propose a research agenda that enables information systems (IS) research to address the identified limitations—involving conceptual, scoping, and methodological issues—and provide specific recommendations on how to address the identified issues in future IS research. Finally, we propose five major research topics for further inquiry by combining the challenges identified in current knowledge with the current shift toward hyper-connected ecosystems underlying digital innovation.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Large language models (LLMs) represent a major advance in artificial intelligence (AI) research. However, the widespread use of LLMs is also coupled with significant ethical and social challenges. Previous research has pointed towards auditing as a promising governance mechanism to help ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in ways that are ethical, legal, and technically robust. However, existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, which display emergent capabilities and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In this article, we address that gap by outlining a novel blueprint for how to audit LLMs. Specifically, we propose a three-layered approach, whereby governance audits (of technology providers that design and disseminate LLMs), model audits (of LLMs after pre-training but prior to their release), and application audits (of applications based on LLMs) complement and inform each other. We show how audits, when conducted in a structured and coordinated manner on all three levels, can be a feasible and effective mechanism for identifying and managing some of the ethical and social risks posed by LLMs. However, it is important to remain realistic about what auditing can reasonably be expected to achieve. Therefore, we discuss the limitations not only of our three-layered approach but also of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all. Ultimately, this article seeks to expand the methodological toolkit available to technology providers and policymakers who wish to analyse and evaluate LLMs from technical, ethical, and legal perspectives.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Data scarcity is a major challenge when training deep learning (DL) models. DL demands a large amount of data to achieve exceptional performance. Unfortunately, many applications have small or inadequate data to train DL frameworks. Usually, manual labeling is needed to provide labeled data, which typically involves human annotators with a vast background of knowledge. This annotation process is costly, time-consuming, and error-prone. Usually, every DL framework is fed by a significant amount of labeled data to automatically learn representations. Ultimately, a larger amount of data would generate a better DL model and its performance is also application dependent. This issue is the main barrier for many applications dismissing the use of DL. Having sufficient data is the first step toward any successful and trustworthy DL application. This paper presents a holistic survey on state-of-the-art techniques to deal with training DL models to overcome three challenges including small, imbalanced datasets, and lack of generalization. This survey starts by listing the learning techniques. Next, the types of DL architectures are introduced. After that, state-of-the-art solutions to address the issue of lack of training data are listed, such as Transfer Learning (TL), Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Model Architecture (MA), Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), and Deep Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (DeepSMOTE). Then, these solutions were followed by some related tips about data acquisition needed prior to training purposes, as well as recommendations for ensuring the trustworthiness of the training dataset. The survey ends with a list of applications that suffer from data scarcity, several alternatives are proposed in order to generate more data in each application including Electromagnetic Imaging (EMI), Civil Structural Health Monitoring, Medical imaging, Meteorology, Wireless Communications, Fluid Mechanics, Microelectromechanical system, and Cybersecurity. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first review that offers a comprehensive overview on strategies to tackle data scarcity in DL.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Recent advancements in deep learning architecture have increased its utility in real-life applications. Deep learning models require a large amount of data to train the model. In many application domains, there is a limited set of data available for training neural networks as collecting new data is either not feasible or requires more resources such as in marketing, computer vision, and medical science. These models require a large amount of data to avoid the problem of overfitting. One of the data space solutions to the problem of limited data is data augmentation. The purpose of this study focuses on various data augmentation techniques that can be used to further improve the accuracy of a neural network. This saves the cost and time consumption required to collect new data for the training of deep neural networks by augmenting available data. This also regularizes the model and improves its capability of generalization. The need for large datasets in different fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, security, and healthcare is also covered in this survey paper. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of recent advancements in data augmentation techniques and their application in various domains.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The wide variety of pricing policies used in practice by data sellers suggests that there are significant challenges in pricing data sets. In this paper, we develop a utility framework that is appropriate for data buyers and the corresponding pricing of the data by the data seller. Buyers interested in purchasing a data set have private valuations in two aspects—their ideal record that they value the most, and the rate at which their valuation for the records in the data set decays as they differ from the buyers’ ideal record. The seller allows individual buyers to filter the data set and select the records that are of interest to them. The multidimensional private information of the buyers coupled with the endogenous selection of records makes the seller’s problem of optimally pricing the data set a challenging one. We formulate a tractable model and successfully exploit its special structure to obtain optimal and near-optimal data-selling mechanisms. Specifically, we provide insights into the conditions under which a commonly used mechanism—namely, a price-quantity schedule—is optimal for the data seller. When the conditions leading to the optimality of a price-quantity schedule do not hold, we show that the optimal price-quantity schedule offers an attractive worst-case guarantee relative to an optimal mechanism. Further, we numerically solve for the optimal mechanism and show that the actual performance of two simple and well-known price-quantity schedules—namely, two-part tariff and two-block tariff—is near optimal. We also quantify the value to the seller from allowing buyers to filter the data set.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm.

Although ChatGPT has successfully generated theoretical information in multiple fields, its ability to identify and describe emotions is still unknown. Emotional awareness (EA), the ability to conceptualize one’s own and others’ emotions, is considered a transdiagnostic mechanism for psychopathology. This study utilized the Levels of Emotional Awareness Scale (LEAS) as an objective, performance-based test to analyze ChatGPT’s responses to twenty scenarios and compared its EA performance with that of the general population norms, as reported by a previous study. A second examination was performed one month later to measure EA improvement over time. Finally, two independent licensed psychologists evaluated the fit-to-context of ChatGPT’s EA responses. In the first examination, ChatGPT demonstrated significantly higher performance than the general population on all the LEAS scales ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} score = 2.84). In the second examination, ChatGPT’s performance significantly improved, almost reaching the maximum possible LEAS score ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} score = 4.26). Its accuracy levels were also extremely high (9.7/10). The study demonstrated that ChatGPT can generate appropriate EA responses, and that its performance may improve significantly over time. The study has theoretical and clinical implications, as ChatGPT can be used as part of cognitive training for clinical populations with EA impairments. In addition, ChatGPT’s EA-like abilities may facilitate psychiatric diagnosis and assessment and be used to enhance emotional language. Further research is warranted to better understand the potential benefits and risks of ChatGPT and refine it to promote mental health. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this position paper, I turn to state-of-the-art psychological insights to explain why this problem is especially persistent in research on automatic emotion detection, and why the seemingly promising approach of using multilingual models to include lower-resourced languages might not be the desired solution. Instead, I campaign for the use of models that acknowledge linguistic and cultural differences in emotion conceptualization and verbalization. Moreover, I see much potential in NLP to better understand emotions and emotional language use across different languages.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Topic modelling is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that has gained popularity in the recent past. It identifies word co-occurrence patterns inside a document corpus to reveal hidden topics. Graph Neural Topic Model (GNTM) is a topic modelling technique that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn document representations effectively. It provides high-precision documents-topics and topics-words probability distributions. Such models find immense application in many sectors, including healthcare, financial services, and safety-critical systems like autonomous cars. This model is not explainable. As a matter of fact, the user cannot comprehend the underlying decision-making process. The paper introduces a technique to explain the documents-topics probability distributions output of GNTM. The explanation is achieved by building a local explainable model such as a probabilistic Naïve Bayes classifier. The experimental results using various benchmark NLP datasets show a fidelity of 88.39\% between the predictions of GNTM and the local explainable model. This similarity implies that the proposed technique can effectively explain the documents-topics probability distribution output of GNTM.},

However, existing topic models fail to learn interpretable topics when working with large and heavy-tailed vocabularies. To this end, we develop the embedded topic model (etm), a generative model of documents that marries traditional topic models with word embeddings. More specifically, the etm models each word with a categorical distribution whose natural parameter is the inner product between the word’s embedding and an embedding of its assigned topic. To fit the etm, we develop an efficient amortized variational inference algorithm. The etm discovers interpretable topics even with large vocabularies that include rare words and stop words. It outperforms existing document models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation, in terms of both topic quality and predictive performance.},

	abstract = {The literature highlights the importance of product review information to a consumer, but limited knowledge exists on the provision of such information in a shopping website. This research uses information foraging theory (IFT) to determine how to provide product reviews. Product reviews differ according to whether the content is mainly on product attributes (i.e., attribute-oriented product reviews) or usage experience (i.e., usage-oriented product reviews). Two empirical studies were conducted. Study 1 examined consumer information diet for product reviews using the think-aloud approach. Results showed that consumers use two different genres of product review information sequentially (1) to follow product attribute-oriented review information during the screening phase and (2) to forage for product usage-oriented review information during the evaluation phase. The findings were extended to Study 2 through a field experiment, in which different patches of product reviews were purposefully and sequentially given in accordance with the consumer information diet for product reviews. The results revealed that an online shopping website could offer varying genres of product reviews at different junctures to enhance consumers’ decision-making performance. This research presents empirical evidence on the effectiveness of embedding product review information on a shopping website. This work further contributes to IFT, which is traditionally descriptive and conceptual in nature, by theorizing information provision and information-foraging behaviors of online consumers.},

We also find differences in word entropy between media categories, with short-form media such as news and magazines having higher entropy than long-form media, and social media feeds having higher entropy still. To explain these results we develop an ecological model of the attention economy that combines ideas from Zipf's law and information foraging. In this model, media consumers maximize information utility rate taking into account the costs of information search, while media producers adapt to technologies that reduce search costs, driving them to generate higher entropy content in increasingly shorter formats.},

	abstract = {Set on its current course thirty years ago by Herbert Simon’s notions of bounded rationality and sequential stages, the research literature of organizational decision making is claimed in this paper to have suffered from three major limitations labeled reification, dehumanization, and isolation. In particular, it has been stuck along a continuum between the cerebral rationality of the stage theories at one end and the apparent irrationality of the theory of organized anarchies at the other. This paper seeks to open up decision making in three respects. First, the concept of “decision” is opened up to the ambiguities that surround the relationship between commitment and action. Second, the decision maker is opened up to history and experience, to affect and inspiration, and especially to the critical role of insight in transcending the bounds of cerebral rationality. Third, the process of decision making is opened up to a host of dynamic linkages, so that isolated traces of single decisions come to be seen as interwoven networks of issues. The paper concludes with a plea to open up research itself to the development of richer theory on these important processes.},

	abstract = {The emerging field of emotion regulation studies how individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them. This review takes an evolutionary perspective and characterizes emotion in terms of response tendencies. Emotion regulation is defined and distinguished from coping, mood regulation, defense, and affect regulation. In the increasingly specialized discipline of psychology, the field of emotion regulation cuts across traditional boundaries and provides common ground. According to a process model of emotion regulation, emotion may be regulated at five points in the emotion generative process: (a) selection of the situation, (b) modification of the situation, (c) deployment of attention, (d) change of cognitions, and (e) modulation of responses. The field of emotion regulation promises new insights into age-old questions about how people manage their emotions.},

	abstract = {People routinely regulate their emotions in order to function more effectively at work, to behave more appropriately in social situations, or simply to feel better. Recently, researchers have begun to examine how people shape their affective states using digital technologies, such as smartphones. In this article, we discuss the emergence of digital emotion regulation, both as a widespread behavioral phenomenon and a new cross-disciplinary field of research. This field bridges two largely distinct areas of enquiry: (a) psychological research into how and why people regulate their emotions, which has yet to systematically explore the role of digital technology, and (b) computing research into how digital technologies impact users’ emotions, which has yet to integrate psychological theories of emotion regulation. We argue that bringing these two areas into better contact will benefit both and will facilitate a deeper understanding of the nature and significance of digital emotion regulation.},

	abstract = {During his second presidency, United States president Donald Trump enacted a series of steep protective tariffs affecting nearly all goods imported into the United States. Upon the second inauguration of Donald Trump in January 2025, the average effective US tariff rate was 2.5\%. It rose to an estimated 27\%, the highest level in over a century, due to the Liberation Day tariffs. After rollbacks, as of June 1, 2025, the average effective tariff rate was 15.1\%.
Trump escalated the China–United States trade war, raising baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145\%. In retaliation, China imposed a minimum 125\% tariff on US goods and export restrictions on rare earths critical to high tech industries. Trump also initiated a trade war with Canada and Mexico by imposing a 25\% tariff on both countries, but later granted indefinite exemptions for goods compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). He framed these actions as efforts to hold the countries accountable for contraband drug trafficking and illegal immigration, while also supporting domestic manufacturing. Trump subsequently added a 25\% tariff on automobiles and a 50\% tariff on steel and aluminum products from all countries.
On April 2—a day he called "Liberation Day"—Trump announced a minimum 10\% tariff on all US imports, effective April 5, and higher tariffs on imports from 57 countries. The announcement of these controversially named "reciprocal tariffs" prompted retaliation from trade partners and triggered a stock market crash. According to the Trump administration's reciprocal tariff formula, trade deficits are seen as inherently harmful, a view many economists criticized as a flawed understanding of trade. Trump also announced he would close the de minimis exemption for China beginning May 2, and for all countries at a future date.
Higher "reciprocal tariffs", ranging from 11\% to 50\% and meant to take effect April 9, were suspended for 90 days for all countries except China. Tariffs on China were reduced to 30\% for most packages and 54\% for de minimis packages. The 10\% minimum tariff and the 25\% sector-specific tariff remain in effect. The tariffs contributed to downgraded GDP growth projections by the Federal Reserve and OECD and rising expectations of a recession. The White House began negotiating trade deals in May, including significantly reducing tariffs between itself and China, but said the 10\% universal tariff would remain long term.
On May 28, the United States Court of International Trade vacated the "fentanyl tariffs" and "reciprocal tariffs", ruling Trump had overstepped his authority. A Washington D.C. district court issued a preliminary injunction in a similar case the next day. Both decisions were stayed pending appeals, allowing the tariffs to remain in effect.},

	abstract = {In March 2018, U.S. President Trump announced that the U.S. would start imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from most exporting countries around the world. This study explores the impact of introducing these tariffs on the equity return of U.S. defense companies. As the defense industry stands among the largest metal consumers in the U.S., it is expected that these import restrictions have deteriorated the business performance of the U.S. defense industry. For this study, a novel trade uncertainty indicator has been constructed that is based on the key events related to the invocation of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. This section empowers the President to impose trade restrictions when the quantity of imports threatens to impair national security. My empirical analysis reveals that investors perceived the introduction of the steel and aluminum tariffs as detrimental to U.S. defense companies. The negative abnormal stock returns in the days around several key tariff-related events evidence this. Already in the period before the Department of Commerce released the findings of its investigation, investors were speculating on the possible introduction of trade barriers. However, the height of the imposed tariff exceeded their expectations since the negative sentiment was further reinforced after the official announcement of the tariff by President Trump.},
